# ChessGameCPP
A chess game in C++ with multiplayer using console graphics. 

I created this project back in 2009 when I was a sophomore in 3rd semester in graduation as a learning project in C++. I used simple console graphics using various characters with various colors by `cout<<` identifier.

## Code
You can find the code in [ChessGame.cpp](https://github.com/wajahatkarim3/ChessGameCPP/blob/master/ChessGame.cpp) file. I developed in using Dev C++ compiler at that time.
