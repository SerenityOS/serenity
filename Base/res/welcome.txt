kernel.

On the Internet, you can correspond through electronic mail (e-mail), get the

most of which will make you really angry.

Serenity includes several internet applications, such as an IRC (Internet relay
chat) client, WWW browser, telnet server, and basic utilities like ping.

* Fun & Games
$ /res/icons/16x16/app-snake.png
> Play some games!
Serenity includes several games built right into the base system. These include
the classic game Snake and the anti-productivity mainstay Minesweeper.

With a little extra effort, you can even play the original id Software hit DOOM,
albeit without sound. No sound just means you won't alert your boss, so it's
more of a feature than a limitation.

* Development
$ /res/icons/16x16/app-hack-studio.png
> Develop new applications!
Serenity includes several development tools to enable you to create new
applications for Serenity. You can build a new graphical tool, craft a new
server, hack on a kernel, hammer the browser... the possibilities are endless!

This is all possibly by using HackStudio, Terminal, and the (optional) GNU tools.

* Multimedia

> Draw while playing your favorite songs!
Serenity includes the Piano, which allows you to create your own tunes by
simply pressing keys on the keyboard. You can pick the wavetype, octave, and
more! Serenity also has SoundPlayer, which lets you play WAV files.

Serenity also has PixelPaint, which is a layered bitmap editor. Draw with the
pencil and change colors. Try drawing shapes! Can't do that in GIMP!
