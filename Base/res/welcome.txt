kernel.

most of which will make you really angry.

Serenity includes several internet applications, such as an IRC (Internet relay

* Fun & Games
> Play some games!
Serenity includes several games built right into the base system. These include
the classic game Snake and the anti-productivity mainstay Minesweeper.

With a little extra effort, you can even play the original id Software hit DOOM,
albeit without sound. No sound just means you won't alert your boss, so it's
more of a feature than a limitation.
