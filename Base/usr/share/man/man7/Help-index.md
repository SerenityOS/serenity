### Welcome to the SerenityOS on-line help system!

This is the system documentation for SerenityOS, in the form of [man pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page), divided into traditional Unix-style sections. For more details, see [`man`(7)](help://man/7/man). Developer documentation is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/tree/master/Documentation).

Use the [Help](help://man/1/Applications/Help) application to access the man pages within SerenityOS. If you prefer a command-line interface, the [`man`(1)](help://man/1/man) command offers a text-only view of the same library. A website version is also available at [man.serenityos.org](https://man.serenityos.org/).
