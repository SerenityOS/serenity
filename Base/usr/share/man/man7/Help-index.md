## Welcome to the SerenityOS on-line help system!

This is **Help**, the built-in documentation viewer for the SerenityOS desktop environment. If you prefer a command-line interface, the [`man`(1)](help://man/1/man) command offers a text-only view of the same library.

---

Documentation is divided into traditional Unix-style manual categories. Use the **Browse** tab on the left-hand side to navigate by category.

There's also a full-text search option under the **Search** tab.

If you want more information on the structure of the manual system, take a look at [`man(7)`](help://man/7/man).

Thank you for using ***SerenityOS Help!***
