## Description

Chess is an implementation of the 15th century board game played on an 8x8 grid by two opponents, each commanding an army of 16 pieces with distinct movements and powers.

The objective is simple yet complex: to outmaneuver and checkmate the opponent's king, putting it in a position where it cannot escape capture. Every move requires calculated planning, anticipating your adversary's tactics, and adapting strategies to gain positional advantage or execute tactical strikes.

It's easy to pick up and play but incredibly hard to master.

The game can either be played against another human or against the ChessEngine service.
