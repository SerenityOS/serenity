## Description

`About` is an application that displays information about SerenityOS.

On the left is the official Ladyball logo. Designed by Katalin Kult, it combines the Yin-Yang symbol with the distinctive shell pattern of a [ladybird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccinellidae), the projects's insect motif. It symbolizes the SerenityOS philosophy, encompassing the _Serenity Prayer's_ acceptance of the uncontrollable, the _Yin and yang_ concept of balancing opposing forces, and _Lagom_, the Swedish concept of moderation or finding "just the right amount."

Since there are no official releases of the project, the version number is denoted as `1.0-dev` and the revision number reflects the latest Git commit's hash.

Copyright is attributed to the SerenityOS developers. Started by Andreas Kling in 2018, the project has since grown into a thriving global community of volunteers and full-time developers. Contributors with 100+ commits are acknowledged on [GitHub](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity#authors). The project's history is detailed on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SerenityOS).
