## Description

`CatDog` is an animated screenmate application in the form of a virtual pet.

It was inspired by [Neko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neko_(software)). The name derives from its ambiguous appearance: is it a cat, a dog, or a hybrid?

Its helpful suggestions evoke the animated assistants popular at the turn of the millennium, such as [Clippy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant).

Alongside [Buggie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SerenityOS#History) and the [Yaks](http://yaksplained.org/), CatDog is a much loved member of the SerenityOS family of mascots. As such it has a wider presence in the project’s online community, promotional materials and merchandise.

### Features

By default, CatDog will chase your mouse cursor around the screen. It will always stay on-top of other windows.

Additionally, CatDog offers helpful suggestions depending on the currently active application.

CatDog has multiple states:

- *Sleeping* if the mouse cursor hasn’t moved in some time
- *Alert* if woken by the mouse cursor or speaking after being idle
- *Dressed as an Artist* if [Pixel Paint](help://man/1/Applications/PixelPaint) or [Font Editor](help://man/1/Applications/FontEditor) are open
- *Dressed as an Inspector* if [Profiler](help://man/1/Applications/Profiler) or System Monitor are open

To exit, right-click on CatDog and select `Quit` or, if active, press `Alt+F4`.

CatDog brings good luck to those who keep it open.
