## Description

Terminal is a terminal emulator application for Serenity.

It can be launched from the System Menu or the quick access icon to its right, via the `Open in Terminal` action in File Manager and on the Desktop. You can also click on the `Open` link above to launch Terminal.

Select `File â†’ Terminal Settings` to launch the Terminal Settings dialog and display user configurable application properties. This dialog box contains two tabs: View and Terminal.

The *View* tab provides the most frequently sought options:
* Adjust the Terminal font (turn off `Use system default` to select a custom font.
* Specify background opacity, i.e. the amount to which the Terminal's background is transparent, displaying what's underneath.
* Change the shape of the cursor from Block, to Underscore or to Vertical bar. You can also opt to enable or disable cursor's blink property.
* To enable or disable the display of terminal scrollbar.

The *Terminal* tab gives less frequently used options:
* To either enable System beep, or use Visual bell or disable bell mode altogether.
* To change Terminal's exit behavior

Clicking on the *Apply* button will cause the currently selected options to take effect immediately.

You can toggle Fullscreen mode by pressing F11.
