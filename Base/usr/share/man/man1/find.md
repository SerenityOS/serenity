## Name

find - recursively search for files

## Synopsis

```**sh
$ find [-L] [root-paths...] [commands...]
```

## Description

`find` recursively traverses the file hierarchy starting at the given root paths
(or at the current working directory if no root paths have been specified), and
evaluates the given commands for each found file. The commands can be used to
both filter the set of files and to perform actions on them.

If no *action command* (`-print`, `-print0`, or `-exec`) is found among the
specified commands, a `-print` command is implicitly appended.

## Options

* `-L`: Follow symlinks

## Commands

* `-maxdepth n`: Do not descend more than `n` levels below each path given on
  the command line. Specifying `-maxdepth 0` has the effect of only evaluating
  each command line argument.
* `-mindepth n`: Descend `n` levels below each path given on the command line
  before executing any commands. Specifying `-mindepth 1` has the effect of
  processing all files except the command line arguments.
* `-type t`: Checks if the file is of the specified type, which must be one of
  `b` (for block device), `c` (character device), `d` (directory), `l` (symbolic
  link), `p` (FIFO), `f` (regular file), and `s` (socket).
* `-links [-|+]number`: Checks if the file has the given number of hard links.
* `-user name`: Checks if the file is owned by the given user. Instead of a user
  name, a numerical UID may be specified.
* `-group name`: Checks if the file is owned by the given group. Instead of a
  group name, a numerical GID may be specified.
* `-size [-|+]number[bcwkMG]`: Checks if the file uses the specified `n` units of
  space rounded up to the nearest whole unit.

  The '+' and '-' prefixes denote greater than and less than, i.e an exact size
  of `n` units doesn't match. Sizes are always rounded up to the nearest unit,
  empty files, while the latter will match files from 0 to 1,048,575 bytes.
  
  The unit of space may be specified by any of these suffixes:

  * `b`: 512-byte blocks. This is the default unit if no suffix is used.
  * `c`: bytes
  * `w`: two-byte words
  * `k`: kibibytes (1024 bytes)
  * `M`: mebibytes (1024 kibibytes)
  * `G`: gibibytes (1024 mebibytes)

* `-name pattern`: Checks if the file name matches the given global-style
  pattern (case sensitive).
* `-empty`: File is either an empty regular file or a directory containing no
  files.
* `-iname pattern`: Checks if the file name matches the given global-style
  pattern (case insensitive).
* `-readable`: Checks if the file is readable by the current user.
* `-writable`: Checks if the file is writable by the current user.
* `-executable`: Checks if the file is executable, or directory is searchable,
by the current user.
* `-newer file`: Checks if the file last modification time is greater than that
  of the specified reference file. If `file` is a symbolic link and the `-L`
  option is in use, then the last modification time of the file pointed to by
  the symbolic link is used.
* `-anewer file`: Checks if the file last access time is greater than that of
  the specified reference file. If `file` is a symbolic link and the `-L`
  option is in use, then the last access time of the file pointed to by the
  symbolic link is used.
* `-cnewer file`: Checks if the file creation time is greater than that of
  the specified reference file. If `file` is a symbolic link and the `-L`
  option is in use, then the creation time of the file pointed to by the
  symbolic link is used.
* `-print`: Outputs the file path, followed by a newline. Always evaluates to
  true.
* `-print0`: Outputs the file path, followed by a zero byte. Always evaluates to
  true.
* `-exec command... ;`: Executes the given command with any arguments provided,
  substituting the file path for any arguments specified as `{}`. The list of
  arguments must be terminated by a semicolon. Checks if the command exits
  successfully.

The commands can be combined to form complex expressions using the following
operators:

* `! command`: Logical NOT.
* `command1 -o command2`: Logical OR.
* `command1 -a command2`, `command1 command2`: Logical AND.
* `( command )`: Groups commands together for operator priority purposes.

Commands which take a numeric argument `n` (`-links` and `-size` for example),
may be prefixed by a plus sign ('+') or a minus sign ('-'). A plus sign means
"grater than `n`", while a minus sign means "less than `n`". A numeric argument
with no prefix means "exactly equal".

## Examples

```sh
# Output a tree of paths rooted at the current directory:
$ find
# Output only directories:
$ find -type d
# Remove all sockets and any files owned by anon in /tmp:
$ find /tmp "(" -type s -o -user anon ")" -exec rm "{}" ";"
# Concatenate files with weird characters in their names:
$ find -type f -print0 | xargs -0 cat
# Find files with the word "config" in their name:
$ find -name \*config\*
```
