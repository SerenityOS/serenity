## Name

ipc - Inter Process Communication endpoint definition format

## Synopsis

The IPC format of SerenityOS is a domain-specific language (DSL) used to define communication endpoints for IPC.

## Description

These files are human-readable, have no easily detectable filemagic, and define IPC interfaces.
The format is loosely inspired by C++ headers.
