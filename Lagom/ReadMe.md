# Lagom

The Serenity C++ library, for other Operating Systems.

## About

If you want to bring the comfortable Serenity classes with you to another system, look no further. This is basically a "port" of the `AK` and `LibCore` libraries to generic \*nix systems.

*Lagom* is a Swedish word that means "just the right amount." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagom))
