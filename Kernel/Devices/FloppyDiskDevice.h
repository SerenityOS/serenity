// Intel 82078 Floppy Disk controller driver
// Datasheet: https://wiki.qemu.org/images/f/f0/29047403.pdf
//
// The Intel 82078 is a 44-pin package, CHMOS Single Chip Floppy Disk Controller found commonly
// on later PCs in the mid to late 90s. It supports a multitude of floppy drives found in computers
// at the time, up to and including 2.8MB ED Floppy Disks and is software compatible with previous FDCs.
// Drive in this case refers to the actual drive where the media is inserted and a disk is the actual
// magnetic floppy disk media. This controller is emulated by QEMU.
//
// Certain terminology exists in the code of this driver that may be confusing, being that there
// is a lot of code and documentation online that is seemingly conflicting. I've used terms found
// directly in the datasheet however for the sake of completeness I'll explain them here:
//
//      - Cylinder: One full circular 'slice' of the floppy disk. It contains 18 sectors
//                  on a 3.5" floppy disk. It is also known as a 'track'. There are
//                  80 tracks on a single side of a floppy disk.
//      - Sector:   One 512 byte chunk of a track.
//      - Head:     The read write arm found inside the drive itself. On a double sided
//                  floppy disk drive, there are two, one for the top tracks of the disk
//                  and the other for the bottom tracks.
//      - CHS:      Cylinder, Head, Sector. The addressing type this floppy controller
//                  uses to address the disk geometry.
//
// A normal PC System usually contains one or two floppy drives. This controller contains the
// ability to control up to four drives with the one controller, however it is very rare for
// most systems to contain this amount of drives.
//
// The basic operation of the drive involves reseting the drive in hardware, then sending command
// bytes to the FIFO, allowing the command to execute, then flushing the FIFO by reading `n` bytes
// from it. Most commands are multi-parameter and multi-result, so it's best to consult the datasheet
// from page 23. It is recommended that a SENSE command is performed to retrieve valubable interrupt
// information about the performed action.
//
// Reseting the controller involves the following:
//      - Acquire the version ID of the controller.
//      - Reset the DOR register
//      - Deassert software reset bit in the DOR register and assert the DMAGATE pin to initialize DMA mode
//      - Program the Configuration Control Register (CCR) for 3.5" 1.44MB diskettes
//      - Send a SPECIFY command to specify more drive information. Refer to the datasheet
//
// The drive (being mapped to the controller) will then be in a state that will accept the correct media.
// The DMA controller is also set up here, which is on channel 2. This only needs to be done once, the
// read and write commands can toggle the appropriate bits themselves to allow a specific transfer direction.
//
// Recalibrating the drive refers to the act of resetting the head of the drive back to track/cylinder 0. It
// is essentially the same as a seek, however returning the drive to a known position. For the sake of brevity,
// only the recalibrate sequence will be described.
//
//      - Enable the drive and it's motor (all drive motors are manually enabled by us!).
//      - Issue a recalibrate or a seek command
//      - Wait for interrupt
//      - Issue a SENSE command, letting the drive know we handled the interrupt
//      - Flush the FIFO and check the cylinder value to ensure we are at the correct spot.
//
// Once this has been completed, the drive will either be at the desired position or back at cylinder 0.
//
// To perform a READ or a WRITE of the diskette inserted, the following actions must be taken:
//
//      -The drive and it's motor must be enabled
//      -The data rate must be set via CCR
//      -The drive must be then recalibrated to ensure the head has not drifted.
//      -A wait of 500ms or greater must occur to allow the drive to spin up from inertia.
//      -The DMA direction of the transfer is then configured.
//      -The READ or WRITE command is issued to the controller.
//      -A timeout counter is started. This is only for real hardware and is currently not implemented.
//      -Read the result bytes.
//      -Attempt to READ or WRITE to the disk. Intel recommends doing this a max of 3 times before failing.
