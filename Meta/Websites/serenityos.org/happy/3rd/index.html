            <p><b>Hello friends! :^)</b>

            <p>Today we celebrate the third birthday of SerenityOS, counting from the first commit in the
            <a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/">git repository</a>, on October 10, 2018.

            <p>Previous birthdays: <a href="https://serenityos.org/happy/1st">1st</a>, <a href="https://serenityos.org/happy/2nd">2nd</a>.

            <p>What follows is a list of interesting events from the past year, mixed with random development
            screenshots and also reflections from other developers in the SerenityOS community.

            <article>
		<h1>Introduction to SerenityOS</h1>

                <p>SerenityOS is a from-scratch desktop operating system that combines a Unix-like core
                with the look&amp;feel of 1990s productivity software. It's written in modern C++ and
                goes all the way from kernel to web browser. The project aims to build everything in-house
                instead of relying on third-party libraries.

                <p>I started building this system after
        	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3JkNGKZtqM">finishing a 3-month rehabilitation program for drug addiction</a>
                in 2018. I found myself with a lot of time and nothing to spend it on. So I began
                building something I'd always wanted to build: my very own dream OS.

                <p>Parts of my development work is presented in screencast format on 
        	<a href="https://youtube.com/andreaskling">my YouTube channel</a>.
                I also post monthly update videos showcasing new features there.

                <h1>2020-12-06: Working on Reddit support in LibWeb</h1>

                <p>Building a browser takes time, and there's a lot of unglamorous
                work like figuring out why things don't align right. Fortunately it's
                also really fun!

                <h1>2020-12-20: Interview on CppCast</h1>

                <p>I went on the <a href="https://cppcast.com">CppCast</a> podcast with <a href="https://twitter.com/lefticus">Jason Turner</a>
                and <a href="https://twitter.com/robwirving">Rob Irving</a> to talk about SerenityOS.

                <p>It was my first time doing an interview and I was really nervous about it,
                but it turned out very okay!

                <h1>2020-12-20: The 2020 HXP CTF</h1>
                <p>
                SerenityOS was once again featured in the <a href="https://ctf.link/">HXP CTF</a>.
                After being in their 2019 CTF, we spent a whole bunch of time beefing up system security,
                and it definitely helped: This time, only 1 team was able to find an exploit,
                compared to 6 teams in the previous CTF!
                <p>
                Write-ups &amp; exploits from the event:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://hxp.io/blog/79/hxp-CTF-2020-wisdom2/"><b>yyyyyyy</b> found a kernel LPE due to a race condition between execve() and ptrace()</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/allesctf/writeups/blob/master/2020/hxpctf/wisdom2/writeup.md"><b>ALLES! CTF</b> found a kernel LPE due to missing EFLAGS validation in ptrace().</a></li>

                <p>At the start of 2021, hacking YouTuber LiveOverflow published
                a series of videos about SerenityOS, looking into exploits against
                the system.

                <p>I wanted to introduce my YouTube audience to more of the SerenityOS
                developer community, and Linus became the first guest in my developer
                interview series!

                <p>It was really nice to shine a light on someone else doing great work on the project.

                    <img class="avatar nolinkify" src="linusg.png">
                </h1>

                <p>One of my favorite aspects of the past year of SerenityOS development
                is the overall progress on the browser! There's still a ton of work to
                do, but we're starting to get more and more websites into a recognizable
                shape - compared to a year ago, the number of blank pages and crashes
                on load is reduced considerably.

                <p>It's also one of the most collaborative subsystems: everything from
                improving spec compliance in our JavaScript engine and adding some
                basic optimizations to implementing countless Web APIs, and continuous
                work on CSS and DOM has been a team effort. It's great to see everyone
                get comfortable, explore, and eventually become experts in their
                favorite topics of browser and JS engine development!

                <p>It's been so much fun building all these things together, and I'm
                excited to see how far we can get in another year :^)

                <p>DevilutionX is a reverse engineered "port" of the classic game Diablo.
                I ported it to SerenityOS and captured the process in a video.
                To date, this is my most viewed video and thousands of people discovered
                the project through this video.

                <p>On April 1st, I posted a video announcing a new visual and spiritual direction
                for the SerenityOS project. Most people got the joke :^)

                </h1>

                <p>We decided to try out Discord after seeing how it was used to great effect
                in the <a href="https://ziglang.org">Zig language</a> community.

                <p>It's been a huge success! While our IRC channel peaked at about 170 users,
                we've got well over 4000 members on Discord, and it's helped us reach new
                levels of collaboration that were simply not possible with IRC.

                <p>It has also spawned an extremely nerdy culture of <a href="https://github.com/kleinesfilmroellchen/yaksplained">yak-related memes</a>.

                about SerenityOS and everything around it. It was my first live interview, and I was kinda nervous
                but I think it went well!

                <p>JT also did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtV86uL5oD4">heartwarming video review</a> of SerenityOS back around Christmas.

                <h1>2021-04-26: More project maintainers</h1>

                <p>In the interview with JT, one of the things that came up was my own
                scalability as a project maintainer. Up until this point I had been doing
                all the PR review and merging myself.

                <p>After talking about it with JT, I realized that I needed to ask for
                some help from a handful of trusted contributors. It was scary to give up
                a bit of control, but in retrospect it's one of the best decisions I've made. :^)

                <p>At the time of writing, we now have five maintainers in addition to myself (in alphabetical order):
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://twitter.com/the_semicolon_">Ali Mohammadpur</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://twitter.com/bgianf">Brian Gianforcaro</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://twitter.com/gunnarbeutner">Gunnar Beutner</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://twitter.com/horowitz_idan">Idan Horowitz</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://twitter.com/linusgroh">Linus Groh</a></li>
                </ul>

                <p>They each bring their own expertise and passion to the project, and they've been doing a great job
                at keeping the project moving forward while growing.

                <h1>2021-05-16: Some GUI face-lifts</h1>

                <p>Sometimes I like to pick out a part of the GUI that is particularly weak
                and spend some time on improving it. Here I was working on the PixelPaint
                application, and also the system shutdown dialog.

                <p>I was a guest on the <a href="https://zig.show/">Zig SHOWTIME</a> variety show
                from the <a href="https://ziglang.org">Zig language</a> community. The theme was
                "tech, taste and soul" and the interview lasted almost 3 hours. Exhausting but fun!

                <p>Up until this point, SerenityOS was a 32-bit x86-only system. Then came x86_64,
                much thanks to the hard work of <a href="https://twitter.com/gunnarbeutner">Gunnar Beutner</a>
                who decided that the port was <i>going to happen</i>, and then didn't stop until it was up and running!

                </h1>

                <p>The past year of Serenity development has been super exciting! One of my favorite things
                to happen was the bring up of the x86_64 Kernel. Andreas started making baby steps in Feb 2021,
                followed by others contributing additional fixes, until around Jun 2021 when
                <a href="https://twitter.com/gunnarbeutner">Gunnar Beutner</a> started contributing tons
                of patches and with the help of many others got the system booting and running on x86_64.
                In my mind this was a significant symbolic step for the project and the community, onboarding
                another architecture makes the system a bit more real in my mind.

                <p>From the community perspective I found it very inspiring how Gunnar just took the lead and
                started fixing issues left and right. The community saw the momentum and started working
                on fixes as well, and everyone together got the system running.

                <p>I wish Andreas, the SerenityOS project and community, continued success and here's hoping
                for another fruitful year of fun and progress. With the
                <a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/pull/10276">nascent aarch64 port</a> under way by 
                <a href="https://twitter.com/thakis">Nico Weber</a>, and the countless other exciting things
                folks are working on, I'm excited to see what the next year has in store! :^)

                <h1>2021-07-08: SerenityOS Office Hours</h1>

                <p>After an interesting back &amp; forth "discussion" with my YouTube audience
                that started with the question "Am I losing touch with the audience?",
                I decided to put some serious effort into connecting with the audience.

                <p>After some experimentation, I finally arrived at the <b>SerenityOS Office Hours</b>
                format. This is a weekly Q&amp;A livestream that I do every Friday at 4pm Swedish Time.
                People are invited to ask any technical or non-technical question about SerenityOS
                and we dig into whatever topics come up. It has been well-received and I've really
                enjoyed being able to answer questions interactively!

                <p>Check out my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMOpZvQB55bf4FjluKyo01ZnXq75SaU5L">stream archive</a>

                on our TrueType renderer, fixing up things like vertical alignment and glyph sizes.

                <p>I also did some work to support the <b style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif">Microsoft Tahoma</b>
                and <b style="font-family: 'JetBrains Mono', sans-serif">JetBrains Mono</b> typefaces,

                <p>One of the main subprojects in LibJS that was being worked on in 2021 was support for

                which aims to replace the old and awkward <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date">Date API</a>
                with a more modern, unified and fully-featured interface.

                <p>As a result of the efforts of many contributors (with some of the most notable ones

                bring it to a point where it can display complex pages in a somewhat reasonable
                time.

                <p>Here I am using Profiler to examine what appears to be memory allocation
                performance in our regular expression engine.

                <p>The profiling system has matured quite a bit during the last year. It now
                has the ability to capture full-system profiles, and we've got more visualizations
                to aid in performance analysis. :^)

                <p>The tradition of the monthly SerenityOS update video is alive and well,
                ever since my first-ever update video in March 2019.

                <p>Something new this year is that for the last couple of videos, I've been
                joined by Linus in the videos. The sheer amount of things happening month-to-month
                was getting hard to cover by myself, and it's great to share the stage with
                someone else who cares deeply about the project as well.
