    <h1>SerenityOS bug bounty program</h1>
    <p>
        Like any respectable software project, SerenityOS also runs a bug bounty program.
        I don't have a huge budget, but I want to reward good honest work.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will pay <b>$5</b> USD for exploitable bugs in these categories:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Remote code execution.</li>
        <li>Local privilege escalation.</li>
        <li>Arbitrary code execution in the Browser when loading a remote web page.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Rules</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>No rewards for bugs you caused yourself.</li>
        <li>The PoC exploit needs to work against the master branch at the time of claim.</li>
        <li>Max 5 bounties per person.</li>
        <li>No duplicates. If a bug is already reported, only the earliest reporter may claim the reward. This includes bugs found by continuous fuzzing systems.</li>
        <li>No rewards for bugs that require unlikely user interaction or social engineering.</li>
        <li>Remote bugs must be exploitable with an unmodified "default setup" of SerenityOS. Bugs in programs that are not started by default don't qualify.</li>
        <li>The PoC exploit needs to work on a QEMU-emulated CPU that supports SMAP, SMEP, UMIP, NX, WP, and TSD natively.</li>
        <li>SerenityOS always runs with assertions enabled, so you'll need to find a way around them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Rewarded bounties will be listed here, and I will also make a video dissecting each
        exploit and showing what the bug was, and how I fix it.
    </p>
