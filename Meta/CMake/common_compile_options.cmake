# This warning is triggered when one accepts or returns vectors from a function (that is not marked
# with [[gnu::target(...)]]) which would have been otherwise passed in register if the current
# translation unit had been compiled with more permissive flags wrt instruction selection (i. e. if
# one adds -mavx2 to cmdline). This will never be a problem for us since we (a) never use
# different instruction selection options across ABI boundaries; (b) most of the affected functions
# are actually TU-local.
#
# Moreover, even if we somehow properly annotated all of the SIMD helpers, calling them across ABI
# (or target) boundaries would still be very dangerous because of inconsistent and bogus handling of
# [[gnu::target(...)]] across compilers. See https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/64706 and
# https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/17qowl2/comment/k8j2odi .
