<div class="outer"><div class="inner">This should be scrollable vertically because of the padding.<span></span></div></div>
<div class="outer"><div class="inner">This padding represents, within the scrollable overflow rectangle, the box’s own padding so that when its content is scrolled to the end, there is padding between the end-edge of its in-flow (or floated) content and the border edge of the box. It typically ends up being exactly the same size as the box’s own padding, except in a few cases—such as when an out-of-flow positioned element, or the visible overflow of a descendent, has already increased the size of the scrollable overflow rectangle outside the conceptual “content edge” of the scroll container’s content.</div></div>
