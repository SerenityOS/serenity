![Screenshot as of f8fc892](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awesomekling/serenity/master/Meta/screenshot-f8fc892.png)

I always wanted to write my own operating system, but I never took it seriously. Until now.

## Current features

* Pre-emptive multitasking
* Compositing window server
* ext2 filesystem support
* mmap()
* Unix-like libc and userland
* Pseudoterminals
* Event-driven GUI library
* Other stuff I can't think of right now...
