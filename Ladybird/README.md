# Ladybird

Ladybird is a web browser built on the [LibWeb](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/tree/master/Userland/Libraries/LibWeb) and [LibJS](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/tree/master/Userland/Libraries/LibJS) engines from [SerenityOS](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity) with a cross-platform GUI in Qt.

This is part of the greater SerenityOS project, and the separate repository may eventually be integrated in the [serenity](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity) monorepo.

For more information about Ladybird, see [this blog post](https://awesomekling.github.io/Ladybird-a-new-cross-platform-browser-project/).
