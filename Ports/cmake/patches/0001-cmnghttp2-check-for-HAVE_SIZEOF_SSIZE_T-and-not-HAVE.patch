Subject: [PATCH 1/7] cmnghttp2: check for HAVE_SIZEOF_SSIZE_T and not
 HAVE_SSIZE_T

The `check_size_type(ssize_t SIZEOF_SSIZE_T` call in cmcurl (referenced
by the comment above, which also references some other variables that
no longer seem to be used) defines HAVE_SIZEOF_SSIZE_T and not
HAVE_SSIZE_T.
The HAVE_SSIZE_T variable *does* get defined, but via the
`CHECK_SIZE_TYPE(ssize_t SSIZE_T)` call in cmlibarchive, which gets
configured *after* cmnghttp2, and so the first configure leads to an
invalid cmnghttp2/config.h file.

- [ ] Local?
- [X] Should be merged to upstream?
- [ ] Resolves issues(s) with our side of things
- [ ] Hack
