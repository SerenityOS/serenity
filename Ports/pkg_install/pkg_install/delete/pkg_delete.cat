     The ppkkgg__ddeelleettee command is used to delete packages that have been
     previously installed with the pkg_add(1) command.  The given packages are
     sorted, so that the dependencies needed by a package are deleted after
     the package.  Before any action is executed, ppkkgg__ddeelleettee checks for
     packages that are marked as pprreesseerrvveedd or have depending packages left.
     If the --kk flag is given, preserved packages are skipped and not removed.
     Unless the --ff flag is given, ppkkgg__ddeelleettee stops on the first error.

     The following command line options are supported:

     _p_k_g_-_n_a_m_e _._._.
             The named packages are deinstalled, wildcards can be used, see
             pkg_info(1).  If no version is given, the one currently installed
             will be removed.  If the --FF flag is given, one or more (absolute)
             filenames may be specified and the package database will be
             consulted for the package to which the given file belongs.  These
             packages are then deinstalled.

     --AA      Recursively remove all automatically installed packages that were
             needed by the given packages and are no longer required.  Does
             not remove manually installed packages; see also the --RR flag.

     --DD      If a deinstallation script exists for a given package, do not
             execute it.

     --FF      Any _p_k_g_-_n_a_m_e given will be interpreted as pathname which is
             subsequently transformed in a (real) package name via the package
             database.  That way, packages can be deleted by giving a filename
             instead of the package-name.

     --ff      Force removal of the package, even if a dependency is recorded or
             the deinstall script fails.  This might break the package
             database; see pkg_admin(1) on how to repair it.

     --ffff     Force removal of the package, even if the package is marked as a
             pprreesseerrvveedd package.  Note that this is a dangerous operation.  See
             also the --kk option.

     --KK _p_k_g___d_b_d_i_r
             Override the value of the PKG_DBDIR configuration option with the
             value _p_k_g___d_b_d_i_r.

     --kk      Silently skip all packages that are marked as pprreesseerrvveedd.

     --NN      Remove the package's registration and its entries from the
             package database, but leave the files installed.  Don't run any
             deinstall scripts or @@uunneexxeecc lines either.

     --nn      Don't actually deinstall a package, just report the steps that
             would be taken.

     --OO      Only delete the package's entries from the package database; do
             not touch the package or its files itself.

     --PP _d_e_s_t_d_i_r
             Prefix all file and directory names with _d_e_s_t_d_i_r.  For packages
             without install scripts this has the same behavior as using
             chroot(8).

     --pp _p_r_e_f_i_x
             Set _p_r_e_f_i_x as the directory in which to delete files from any
             installed packages which do not explicitly set theirs.  For most
             packages, the prefix will be set automatically to the installed
             location by pkg_add(1).

     --RR      Recursively remove all packages that were needed by the given
             packages and are no longer required.  This option overrides the
             --AA flag.

     --rr      Recursively remove all packages that require one of the packages
             given.

     --VV      Print version number and exit.

     --vv      Turn on verbose output.

TTEECCHHNNIICCAALL DDEETTAAIILLSS
     ppkkgg__ddeelleettee does pretty much what it says.  It examines installed package
     records in _<_P_K_G___D_B_D_I_R_>_/_<_p_k_g_-_n_a_m_e_>, deletes the package contents, and
     finally removes the package records.

     If a package is required by other installed packages, ppkkgg__ddeelleettee will
     list those dependent packages and refuse to delete the package (unless
     the --ff option is given).

     If a package has been marked as a pprreesseerrvveedd package, it will not be able
     to be deleted (unless more than one occurrence of the --ff option is
     given).

     If a filename is given instead of a package name, the package of which
     the given file belongs to can be deleted if the --FF flag is given.  The
     filename needs to be absolute, see the output produced by the pkg_info(1)
     --aaFF command.

     If a ddeeiinnssttaallll script exists for the package, it is executed before and
     after any files are removed.  It is this script's responsibility to clean
     up any additional messy details around the package's installation, since
     all ppkkgg__ddeelleettee knows how to do is delete the files created in the
     original distribution.  The ddeeiinnssttaallll script is called as:
           ddeeiinnssttaallll <_p_k_g_-_n_a_m_e> _D_E_I_N_S_T_A_L_L
     before deleting all files and as:
           ddeeiinnssttaallll <_p_k_g_-_n_a_m_e> _P_O_S_T_-_D_E_I_N_S_T_A_L_L
     after deleting them.  Passing the keywords _D_E_I_N_S_T_A_L_L and _P_O_S_T_-_D_E_I_N_S_T_A_L_L
     lets you potentially write only one program/script that handles all
     aspects of installation and deletion.

     All scripts are called with the environment variable PKG_PREFIX set to
     the installation prefix (see the --pp option above).  This allows a package
     author to write a script that reliably performs some action on the
     directory where the package is installed, even if the user might have
     changed it by specifying the --pp option when running ppkkgg__ddeelleettee or
     pkg_add(1).  The scripts are also called with the PKG_METADATA_DIR
     environment variable set to the location of the _+_* meta-data files, and
     with the PKG_REFCOUNT_DBDIR environment variable set to the location of
     the package reference counts database directory.  If the --PP flag was
     given to ppkkgg__ddeelleettee, PKG_DESTDIR will be set to _d_e_s_t_d_i_r.
