Each line has the format
.Ev VARIABLE=VALUE .
If the value consists of more than one line, each line is prefixed with
.Ev VARIABLE= .
.Pp
The current value of a variable can be checked by running
.Dl Ic pkg_admin config-var VARIABLE
.Pp
Some variables are overriden by environmental variables of the same name.
Those are marked by (*).
.Pp
