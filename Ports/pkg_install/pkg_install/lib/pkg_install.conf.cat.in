     ppkkgg__iinnssttaallll..ccoonnff - configuration file for package installation tools

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The file ppkkgg__iinnssttaallll..ccoonnff contains system defaults for the package
     installation tools as a list of variable-value pairs.  Each line has the
     format VARIABLE=VALUE.  If the value consists of more than one line, each
     line is prefixed with VARIABLE=.

     The current value of a variable can be checked by running
           ppkkgg__aaddmmiinn ccoonnffiigg--vvaarr VVAARRIIAABBLLEE

     Some variables are overriden by environmental variables of the same name.
     Those are marked by (*).

     The following variables are supported:

     ACCEPTABLE_LICENSES
             Space-separated list of licenses packages are allowed to carry.
             License names are case-sensitive.

     ACTIVE_FTP
             Force the use of active FTP.

     CACHE_INDEX
             Cache directory listings in memory.  This avoids retransfers of
             the large directory index for HTTP and is enabled by default.

     CERTIFICATE_ANCHOR_PKGS
             Path to the file containing the certificates used for validating
             binary packages.  A package is trusted when a certificate chain
             ends in one of the certificates contained in this file.  The
             certificates must be PEM-encoded.

     CERTIFICATE_ANCHOR_PKGVULN
             Analogous to CERTIFICATE_ANCHOR_PKGS.  The _p_k_g_-_v_u_l_n_e_r_a_b_i_l_i_t_i_e_s is
             trusted when a certificate chain ends in one of the certificates
             contained in this file.

     CERTIFICATE_CHAIN
             Path to a file containing additional certificates that can be
             used for completing certificate chains when validating binary
             packages or pkg-vulnerabilities files.

     CHECK_LICENSE
             Check the license conditions of packages before installing them.
             Supported values are:

             no             The check is not performed.

             yes            The check is performed if the package has license
                            conditions set.

             always         Passing the license check is required.  Missing
                            license conditions are considered an error.

     CHECK_END_OF_LIFE
             During vulnerability checks, consider packages that have reached
             end-of-life as vulnerable.  This option is enabled by default.

     CHECK_OS_VERSION
             If "no", pkg_add will not warn if the host OS version does not
             exactly match the OS version the package was built on.  The
             default is "yes".

     CHECK_OSABI
             If "no", osabi package does not check OS version.  The default is
             "yes".

     CHECK_VULNERABILITIES
             Check for vulnerabilities when installing packages.  Supported
             values are:

             never          No check is performed.

             always         Passing the vulnerability check is required.  A
                            missing pkg-vulnerabilities file is considered an
                            error.

             interactive    The user is always asked to confirm installation
                            of vulnerable packages.

     CONFIG_CACHE_CONNECTIONS
             Limit the global connection cache to this value.  For FTP, this
             is the number of sessions without active command.  For HTTP, this
             is the number of connections open with keep-alive.

     CONFIG_CACHE_CONNECTIONS_HOST
             Like CONFIG_CACHE_CONNECTIONS, but limit the number of
             connections to the host as well.  See fetch(3) for further
             details

     DEFAULT_ACCEPTABLE_LICENSES
             Space-separated list of common Free and Open Source licenses
             packages are allowed to carry.  The default value contains all
             OSI approved licenses in pkgsrc on the date pkg_install was
             released.  License names are case-sensitive.

     GPG     Path to gpg(1), which can be used to verify the signature in the
             _p_k_g_-_v_u_l_n_e_r_a_b_i_l_i_t_i_e_s file when running
                   ppkkgg__aaddmmiinn cchheecckk--ppkkgg--vvuullnneerraabbiilliittiieess --ss

                   ppkkgg__aaddmmiinn ffeettcchh--ppkkgg--vvuullnneerraabbiilliittiieess --ss
             It can also be used to verify and sign binary packages.

     GPG_KEYRING_PKGVULN
             Non-default keyring to use for verifying GPG signatures of
             _p_k_g_-_v_u_l_n_e_r_a_b_i_l_i_t_i_e_s.

             Non-default keyring to use for signing packages with GPG.

     GPG_KEYRING_VERIFY
             Non-default keyring to use for verifying GPG signature of
             packages.

     GPG_SIGN_AS
             User-id to use for signing packages.

     IGNORE_PROXY
             Use direct connections and ignore FTP_PROXY and HTTP_PROXY.

     IGNORE_URL
             One line per advisory which should be ignored when running

             value.

     PKG_DBDIR (*)
