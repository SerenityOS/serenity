Subject: [PATCH 4/4] Tweak `setup.py`

Make some tweaks to Python's `setup.py`:

- Add `/usr/local/lib` and `/usr/local/include` to the system lib and
  include dirs respectively, relative to the sysroot when
  crosscompiling. These are by default only included when not
  crosscompiling for some reason.
- Add `/usr/local/include/ncurses` to the curses include paths so it can
  build the `_curses` module. This is by default included for a bunch of
  extensions, but not `_curses`.
