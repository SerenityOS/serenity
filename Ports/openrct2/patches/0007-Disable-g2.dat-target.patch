Subject: [PATCH] Disable g2.dat target

Normally, the build system uses one of the compiled binaries to pack assets into `g2.dat`. However, since we cross-compile this binary for Serenity, we can't do this on the host system. Instead, we download the latest Linux build of OpenRCT2 and copy its `g2.dat` into the disk image.
