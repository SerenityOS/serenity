# Patches for qt6-qtbase on SerenityOS

## `0001-Add-a-SerenityOS-platform-definition.patch`

Add a SerenityOS platform definition


## `0002-Disable-shared-memory-and-semaphores.patch`

Disable shared memory and semaphores

It's probably not done in the cleanest way but it works

## `0003-Serenity-doesn-t-support-utimensat-and-UTIME_NOW.patch`

Serenity doesn't support utimensat and UTIME_NOW


## `0004-Hack-Force-searching-for-plugins-in-usr-local.patch`

Hack: Force searching for plugins in /usr/local

I really don't know how else to do this but I'm sure there is a proper
way to handle this. But this works and doesn't break the system so
whatever for now.

## `0005-Disable-version-tagging.patch`

Disable version tagging

This is necessary because as of now, Serenity doesn't support DT_VERSYM
and other related ELF objects

## `0006-Serenity-Disable-local-domain-name-lookup-via-resolv.patch`

Serenity: Disable local domain name lookup via resolv

Serenity doesn't support /etc/resolv.conf or the structures in
<resolv.h> to do Unix-like domain name resolution.
