# Patches for bdwgc on SerenityOS

## `0001-Teach-os_dep-and-gcconfig.h-about-serenity.patch`

Teach os_dep and gcconfig.h about serenity


## `0002-Error-on-unknown-arch.patch`

Error on unknown arch


## `0003-Teach-dyn_load.c-about-serenity.patch`

## `0004-Teach-bdwgc-about-serenity-signals.patch`

Teach bdwgc about serenity signals

Serenity doesn't have the realtime POSIX signals, so use SIGXCPU and
SIGXFSZ instead.

## `0005-Explicitly-link-with-pthread.patch`

Explicitly link with pthread

The cmakelists was using the wrong variable to link against pthread.

## `0006-Make-the-collector-build-with-threads.patch`

Make the collector build with threads

In an extremely limited way for now:
- No extra threads
    More threads always lead to exactly one borked thread that's stuck
    in no man's land, doing who-knows-what, and definitely not
    responding to signals.
    However, the APIs are there and they work, so they *can* be used to
    make threads.
- No fork handling
    Seems borked for unknown reasons.
