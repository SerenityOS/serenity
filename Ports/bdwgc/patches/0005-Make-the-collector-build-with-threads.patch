Subject: [PATCH] Make the collector build with threads

In an extremely limited way for now:
- No extra threads
    More threads always lead to exactly one borked thread that's stuck
    in no man's land, doing who-knows-what, and definitely not
    responding to signals.
    However, the APIs are there and they work, so they *can* be used to
    make threads.
- No fork handling
    Seems borked for unknown reasons.
