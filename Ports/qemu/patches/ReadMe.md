# Patches for qemu on SerenityOS

## `0001-Add-build-system-support-for-SerenityOS.patch`

Add build system support for SerenityOS


## `0002-Extend-short-scan-sets-into-the-full-list.patch`

Extend short scan sets into the full list

We don't support the (apparently nonstandard) short variant of scan
sets, so extend them into a full list manually.
