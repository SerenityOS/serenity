Subject: [PATCH] Tell TBB that SerenityOS does not support weak symbols

Something about the Clang toolchain configuration causes undefined weak
references to scalable_malloc to remain in the mold executable even
though there's no chance we'll be loading the tbbmalloc library at
runtime. So, just lie to TBB that we don't support weak symbols.
