# What's this?

Serenity has software patched to run on it.
These shell scripts will allow you to build that sort of software, easily.
For example, if you want to install SDL2, simply run its package.sh script.
Note that you should have already built Serenity, and be in a Serenity build environment.

# Using ports scripts

To do everything, just run the script: `./package.sh`
To do a single step, you can specify it: `./package.sh build`

# How do I contribute?

Port software, and add new scripts to build it of course :)
