# Three Australian stations in Antarctica have changed their time zone:
# Casey moved from UTC+8 to UTC+11
# Davis moved from UTC+7 to UTC+5
# Mawson moved from UTC+6 to UTC+5
# The changes occurred on 2009-10-18 at 02:00 (local times).

# From Steffen Thorsen (2010-03-10):
# We got these changes from the Australian Antarctic Division: ...
#
# - Casey station reverted to its normal time of UTC+8 on 5 March 2010.
# The change to UTC+11 is being considered as a regular summer thing but
# has not been decided yet.
#
# - Davis station will revert to its normal time of UTC+7 at 10 March 2010
# 20:00 UTC.

# - Mawson station stays on UTC+5.
#
# Background:

# From Steffen Thorsen (2016-10-28):
# Australian Antarctica Division informed us that Casey changed time

# From Steffen Thorsen (2020-10-02, as corrected):
# Based on information we have received from the Australian Antarctic
# Division, Casey station and Macquarie Island station will move to Tasmanian
# daylight savings time on Sunday 4 October. This will take effect from 0001
# hrs on Sunday 4 October 2020 and will mean Casey and Macquarie Island will

# From Craig Mundell (1994-12-15):
# http://quest.arc.nasa.gov/antarctica/QA/computers/Directions,Time,ZIP
# Vostok, which is one of the Russian stations, is set on the same
# time as Moscow, Russia.
#
# From Lee Hotz (2001-03-08):
# I queried the folks at Columbia who spent the summer at Vostok and this is
# what they had to say about time there:
# "in the US Camp (East Camp) we have been on New Zealand (McMurdo)
# time, which is 12 hours ahead of GMT. The Russian Station Vostok was
# 6 hours behind that (although only 2 miles away, i.e. 6 hours ahead
# of GMT). This is a time zone I think two hours east of Moscow. The
# natural time zone is in between the two: 8 hours ahead of GMT."
#
# From Paul Eggert (2001-05-04):
# This seems to be hopelessly confusing, so I asked Lee Hotz about it
# in person.  He said that some Antarctic locations set their local
# time so that noon is the warmest part of the day, and that this
# changes during the year and does not necessarily correspond to mean
# solar noon.  So the Vostok time might have been whatever the clocks
# happened to be during their visit.  So we still don't really know what time
# it is at Vostok.  But we'll guess +06.

# Siple, the first commander of the South Pole station,
# stated that he would have liked to have kept GMT at the station,
# but that he found it more convenient to keep GMT+12
# as supplies for the station were coming from McMurdo Sound,
# which was on GMT+12 because New Zealand was on GMT+12 all year
# at that time (1957).  (Source: Siple's book 90 Degrees South.)
#
# From Susan Smith
# http://www.cybertours.com/whs/pole10.html
# (1995-11-13 16:24:56 +1300, no longer available):
# We use the same time as McMurdo does.
# And they use the same time as Christchurch, NZ does....
# One last quirk about South Pole time.
# All the electric clocks are usually wrong.
# Something about the generators running at 60.1hertz or something
# makes all of the clocks run fast.  So every couple of days,
# we have to go around and set them back 5 minutes or so.
# Maybe if we let them run fast all of the time, we'd get to leave here sooner!!
#
