# This file identifies the root of the test-suite hierarchy.
# It also contains test-suite configuration information.

# The list of keywords supported in the entire test suite.  The
# "intermittent" keyword marks tests known to fail intermittently.
# The "randomness" keyword marks tests using randomness with test
# cases differing from run to run. (A test using a fixed random seed
# would not count as "randomness" by this definition.) Extra care
# should be taken to handle test failures of intermittent or
# randomness tests.
