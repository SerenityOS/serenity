            SampleAPI Generator for javadoc

1. General description

    The primary goal is to provide one or more data sets to be used as input
to the javadoc tool, such that it can be used to generate representative samples
of all the different content on all the different types of pages that can be
generated by javadoc.

    The tool is implemented as generator based on xml descriptions of data sets.
The xml description of data set provides top level entities (class, interface,
enum, annotation) with all possible content. Desired output parameters (fields,
methods, inner/nested classes) are also described in xml as lists of modifiers,
types and annotations. The generator "multiply" the entities from the lists
providing the set of all possible combinations.

    After the api generation the tool connects the javadoc style comments to
the generated entities with full possible sets of supported tags.
