The utilities in this directory can be used to determine
common issues in javadoc comments by running the standard
"tidy" program on the output of javadoc, and analysing
the messages that are reported.

tidy.sh is a script that will run the "tidy" program on
the files in a directory, writing the results to a new
directroy.

tidystats.Main is a Java program that can analyze the 
files produced by the tidy.sh script to generate a 
summary report about the warnings that were found.


The tests is this directory are focussed on verifying
that doclint detects issues in javadoc comments that will
give rise to issues detected by "tidy" in the output
generated by javadoc. 

For more information on the "tidy" program, see the HTML Tidy
Library Project page at http://tidy.sourceforge.net/.
