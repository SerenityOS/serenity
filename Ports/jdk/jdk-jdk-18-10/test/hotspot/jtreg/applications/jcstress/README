The tests located under this directory run tests from the Java Concurrency
Stress test suite[1] (a.k.a. jcstress). This suite aims to verify the
correctness of concurrency support in the JDK.

All the tests are run through the test driver class -- JcstressRunner, which
downloads the specified build of org.openjdk.jcstress:jcstress-tests-all,
spawns a new JVM to run one jcstress test and checks that it finishes
successfully.

When the used version of org.openjdk.jcstress:jcstress-tests-all needs to be
changed, one should make corresponding changes to the artifact description in
JcstressRunner and rerun applications.jcstress.TestGenerator.

The */Test.java files should never be modified directly, because they are
generated by TestGenerator and therefore all required changes must be made in
that class.
