 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/EventRequest/setEnabled/setenabled003.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [jpda, jdi, quarantine]
 * VM Testbase comments: 8066993
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     The test for the implementation of an object of the type
 *     EventRequest.
 *     The test checks up that a result of the method
 *     com.sun.jdi.EventRequest.setEnabled()
 *     complies with its spec:
 *     public void setEnabled(boolean val)
 *      Enables or disables this event request.
 *      While this event request is disabled, the event request will be ignored and
 *      the target VM will not be stopped if any of its threads reaches the event request.
 *      Disabled event requests still exist, and are included in event request lists
 *      such as EventRequestManager.breakpointRequests().
 *      Parameters: val - true if the event request is to be enabled; false otherwise.
 *      Throws: InvalidRequestStateException -
 *              if this request has been deleted.
 *              IllegalThreadStateException -
 *              if this is a StepRequest, val is true, and
 *              the thread named in the request has died.
 *     The test checks up on the following assertion:
 *       - IllegalThreadStateException  - if this is a StepRequest, val is true, and
 *                                        the thread named in the request has died.
 *     The cases to test include three states of the thread named in the request:
 *     not started, running, dead.
 *     The test works as follows:
 *     The debugger program - nsk.jdi.EventRequest.setEnabled.setenabled003;
 *     the debuggee program - nsk.jdi.EventRequest.setEnabled.setenabled003a.
 *     Using nsk.jdi.share classes,
 *     the debugger gets the debuggee running on another JavaVM,
 *     creates the object debuggee.VM, and waits for VMStartEvent.
 *     Upon getting the debuggee VM started,
 *     the debugger calls corresponding debuggee.VM methods to get
 *     needed data and to perform checks.
 *     In case of error the test produces the return value 97 and
 *     a corresponding error message(s).
 *     Otherwise, the test is passed and produces
 *     the return value 95 and no message.
