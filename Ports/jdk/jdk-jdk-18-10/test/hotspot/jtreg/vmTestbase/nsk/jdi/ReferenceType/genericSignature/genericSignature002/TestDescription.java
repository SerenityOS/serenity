 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *     nsk/jdi/ReferenceType/genericSignature/genericSignature002 test:
 *     The test for the ReferenceType.genericSignature() method.
 *     The test checks up ReferenceType.genericSignature() method
 *     for InterfaceType objects.
 *     The first: the test checks that genericSignature() method returns
 *     null for arrays of reference types which have a InterfaceType as
 *     its type.
 *     The second: the test checks that genericSignature() method returns
 *     null for InterfaceType types which are not generic types.
 *     At last: the test checks that genericSignature() method returns
 *     a corresponding signature string for InterfaceType types which are
 *     generic types.
