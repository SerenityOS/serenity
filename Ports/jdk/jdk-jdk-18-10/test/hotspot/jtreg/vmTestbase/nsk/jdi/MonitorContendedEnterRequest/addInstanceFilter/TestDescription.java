 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdi, feature_jdk6_jpda, vm6]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *         The test checks up that a result of the method com.sun.jdi.MonitorContendedEnterRequest.addInstanceFilter(ObjectReference instance)
 *         complies with its spec:
 *         "Restricts the events generated by this request to those in which the currently executing instance ("this") is
 *         the object specified."
 *         Test also checks that received com.sun.jdi.MonitorContendedEnterEvent complies with its spec and contains correct data.
 *         Test uses following instances filters:
 *                 - add to request filter for single object
 *                 - add to request filter for the same object 2 times, expect behavior such as in previous case
 *                 - add to request filter for 2 different objects, so events shouldn't be received
 *         Test executes class nsk.share.jdi.ClassExclusionFilterTest which uses JDI events testing
 *         framework based on classes from package nsk.share.jdi.*.
 *         This framework uses following scenario:
 *                 - debugger VM forces debugge VM to create number of objects which should generate events during test
 *                 - if any event filters are used each generating event object is checked is this object accepted by all filters,
 *                 if object was accepted it should save information about all generated events and this information is available for debugger
 *                 - debuggee performs event generation and stop at breakpoint
 *                 - debugger reads data saved by debuggee's event generators and checks is only expected events was generated
 *         Monitor enter events are generated in 3 different ways:
 *                 - through synchronized block
 *                 - through synchronized method
 *                 - through JNI MonitorEnter
 *         In addition to the main scenario tests using event filters also check following cases:
 *                 - attempt to add filter to enabled or deleted request throws 'InvalidRequestStateException'
 *                 - corresponding method EventRequestManager.xxxRequests() returns created event request
