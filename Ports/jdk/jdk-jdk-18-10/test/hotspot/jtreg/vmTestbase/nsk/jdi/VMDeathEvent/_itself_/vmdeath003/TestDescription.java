 * @test
 *
 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/VMDeathEvent/_itself_/vmdeath003.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     The test for the implementation of an object of the type
 *     VMDeathEvent.
 *     The test checks up that the intefrace com.sun.jdi.VMDeathEvent
 *     complies with its spec:
 *     public interface VMDeathEvent
 *     extends Event
 *     Notification of target VM termination. This event occurs
 *     if the target VM terminates before the VM disconnects (VMDisconnectEvent).
 *     Thus, this event will NOT occur if external forces terminate the connection
 *     (e.g. a crash) or if the
 *     connection is intentionally terminated with VirtualMachine.dispose()
 *     On VM termination, a single unsolicited VMDeathEvent will always be sent
 *     with a suspend policy of SUSPEND_NONE.
 *     Additional VMDeathEvents will be sent in the same event set if
 *     they are requested with a VMDeathRequest.
 *     The VM is still intact and can be queried at the point this event was initiated
 *     but immediately thereafter it is not considered intact and cannot be queried.
 *     Note: If the enclosing EventSet has a suspend policy other than
 *     SUSPEND_ALL the initiating point may be long past.
 *     All VMDeathEvents will be in a single EventSet,
 *     no other events will be in the event set.
 *     A resume must occur to continue execution
 *     after any event set which performs suspensions -
 *     in this case to allow proper shutdown.
 *     The test checks that
 *     this event will NOT occur if
 *     the connection is intentionally terminated with VirtualMachine.dispose()
 *     The test works as follows:
 *     The debugger program - nsk.jdi.VMDeathEvent._itself_.vmdeath003;
 *     the debuggee program - nsk.jdi.VMDeathEvent._itself_.vmdeath003a.
 *     Using nsk.jdi.share classes,
 *     the debugger gets the debuggee running on another JavaVM,
 *     creates the object debuggee.VM, and waits for VMStartEvent.
 *     Upon getting the debuggee VM started,
 *     the debugger calls corresponding debuggee.VM methods to get
 *     needed data and to perform checks.
 *     In case of error the test produces the return value 97 and
 *     a corresponding error message(s).
 *     Otherwise, the test is passed and produces
 *     the return value 95 and no message.
 * COMMENTS:
 *     Test fixed according to test bug:
 *     4778296 TEST_BUG: debuggee VM intemittently hangs after resuming
 *       - waiting for VMStartEvent removed because it is handled now in
 *         binder.bindToDebugee() method
