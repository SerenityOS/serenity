 * @test
 *
 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jvmti/PopFrame/popframe002.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jvmti, noras]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *     This test checks that the JVMTI function PopFrame() correctly
 *     returns the following errors:
 *      - JVMTI_ERROR_INVALID_THREAD;
 *      - JVMTI_ERROR_THREAD_NOT_SUSPENDED
 *     and no JVMTI events will be generated by the function.
 *     The test creates an instance of inner class popFrameCls and start
 *     it in a separate thread. Then the test tries to pop frame with
 *     the following erroneous thread's parameter of the PopFrame():
 *     - NULL pointer to the thread;
 *     - an invalid thread;
 *     - the non suspended popFrameCls' thread.
 * COMMENTS
 *     The test was changed due to the bug 4448675.
 *     Ported from JVMDI.
