 * @test
 *
 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/WatchpointRequest/addInstanceFilter/instancefilter003.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     The test for the implementation of an object of the type
 *     WatchpointRequestRequest.
 *     The test checks up that a result of the method
 *     com.sun.jdi.MethodExitRequest.addInstanceFilter()
 *     complies with its spec:
 *     public void addInstanceFilter(ObjectReference instance)
 *      Restricts the events generated by this request to those in which
 *      the currently executing instance is the object specified.
 *      Not all targets support this operation.
 *      Use VirtualMachine.canUseInstanceFilters() to determine
 *      if the operation is supported.
 *      Parameters: instance - the object which must be the current instance
 *                             in order to pass this filter.
 *      Throws: UnsupportedOperationException -
 *              if the target virtual machine does not support this operation.
 *              InvalidRequestStateException -
 *              if this request is currently enabled or has been deleted.
 *              Filters may be added only to disabled requests.
 *     The test checks up on the following assertion:
 *          InvalidRequestStateException -
 *          if this request is currently enabled or has been deleted.
 *     This request is AccessWatchpointRequest.
 *     The test works as follows:
 *     The debugger program - nsk.jdi.WatchpointRequest.addInstanceFilter.instancefilter003;
 *     the debuggee program - nsk.jdi.WatchpointRequest.addInstanceFilter.instancefilter003a.
 *     Using nsk.jdi.share classes,
 *     the debugger gets the debuggee running on another JavaVM,
 *     creates the object debuggee.VM, and waits for VMStartEvent.
 *     Upon getting the debuggee VM started,
 *     the debugger calls corresponding debuggee.VM methods to get
 *     needed data and to perform checks.
 *     In case of error the test produces the return value 97 and
 *     a corresponding error message(s).
 *     Otherwise, the test is passed and produces
 *     the return value 95 and no message.
