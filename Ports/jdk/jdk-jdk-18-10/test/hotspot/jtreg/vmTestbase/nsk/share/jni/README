This directory contains source files of testbase_nsk JNI framework,
which provides support for JNI tests and accessing JNI environment.

    Source files:
        jni_tools.h
        jni_tools.c

    Naming conventions:
        macroses:  NSK_JNI_*
        functions: nsk_JNI_*

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

jni_tools.h

Provides functions and macroses for invocation of JNI functions
and checking JNI errors and pending exceptions:

    NSK_JNI_VERIFY(jni, action)
    NSK_JNI_VERIFY_NEGATIVE(jni, action)

Typical example of usage of the NSK_JNI_VERIFY macro
for invokation of JNI functions:

    // jni->FindClass(jni, class_name)
    if (!NSK_JNI_VERIFY(jni,
            jni->FindClass(class_name) != NULL)) {
        return JNI_ERR;
    }

or with saving obtained data:

    // cls = jni->FindClass(jni, class_name)
    if (!NSK_JNI_VERIFY(jni, (cls =
            jni->FindClass(class_name)) != NULL)) {
        return JNI_ERR;
    }
