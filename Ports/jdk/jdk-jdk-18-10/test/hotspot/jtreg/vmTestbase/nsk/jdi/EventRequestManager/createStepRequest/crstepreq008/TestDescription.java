/*
 * @test
 *
 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/EventRequestManager/createStepRequest/crstepreq008.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *   The test checks whether an implementation of
 *       EventRequestManager.createStepRequest (ThreadReference thread, int size, int depth)
 *   method complies with its spec.
 *   The test checks the following assertions:
 *       A sizevalue of StepRequest.STEP_MIN will generate a step event each time
 *       the code index changes. It represents the smallest step size available and
 *       often maps to the instruction level....
 *       A depth value of StepRequest.STEP_OVER restricts step events to the current
 *       frame or caller frames.
 *   The debugger class - nsk.jdi.EventRequestManager.createStepRequest.crstepreq008;
 *   the debuggee class - nsk.jdi.EventRequestManager.createStepRequest.crstepreq008a;
 *   The test works as follows. At first, preliminary phase:
 *    - the debugger connects to the debuggee using nsk.jdi.share classes;
 *    - the debugger waits for the VMStartEvent and requested ClassPrepareEvent for
 *      debuggee class.
 *   At second, test specific phase, each action is performed for every test case:
 *    - the debugger waits for requested BreakpointEvent which is set on a line
 *      of debuggee's methodForCommunication() method. This method is invoked in
 *      additional 'thread1' started in debuggee. First breakpoint allows the debugger
 *      to obtain ThreadReference mirror of debuggee's 'thread1';
 *    - after getting first BreakpointEvent, the debugger sets second BreakpointRequest
 *      to suspend 'thread1 at the right location before setting step request;
 *    - after getting second BreakpointEvent, the debugger sets StepRequest
 *      with STEP_MIN size and STEP_OVER depth, resumes the debuggee and
 *      waits for two consecutive StepEvents;
 *    - upon getting StepEvents, the debugger checks their locations by comparing with
 *      expected line number values.
 *   In case of error the test produces the return value 97 and a corresponding
 *   error message(s). Otherwise, the test is passed and produces the return
 *   value 95 and no message.
 * COMMENTS:
 *     Test was fixed according to test bug:
 *     4778296 TEST_BUG: debuggee VM intemittently hangs after resuming
 *     - remove waiting for VMStartEvent after launching debuggee VM
