 *
 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jvmti/RedefineClasses/redefclass020.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jvmti, noras, redefine]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *     The test exercises JVMTI function RedefineClasses(classCount, classDefs).
 *     The test checks if the function properly returns
 *       - JVMTI_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_REDEFINITION_METHOD_ADDED if new class version
 *         adds a new method.
 * COMMENTS
 *     Ported from JVMDI.
 *     Changed due to new Classfile redifinition mechanism in JVMTI-0.2.x
 *     Currently the spec prohibits adding a method in a new class.
 *
