 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/BScenarios/hotswap/tc01x001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdi, redefine]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     This test is from the group of so-called Borland's scenarios and
 *     implements the following test case:
 *         Suite 3 - Hot Swap
 *         Test case:      TC1
 *         Description:    After point of execution, same method
 *         Steps:          1.Set breakpoint at line 24 (call to b()
 *                            from a())
 *                         2.Debug Main
 *                         3.Insert as next line after point of
 *                            execution: System.err.println("foo");
 *                         4.Smart Swap
 *                         5.Resume
 *                            X. Prints out "foo" after printing the
 *                            numbers
 *     The description was drown up according to steps under JBuilder.
 *     Of course, the test has own line numbers and method/class names and
 *     works as follow:
 *     When the test is starting debugee, debugger sets breakpoint at
 *     the 37th line (method "method_A").
 *     After the breakpoint is reached, debugger redefines debugee adding
 *     a new line into "method_A" and resumes debugee. It is expected the
 *     new code will be NOT actual after the redefining (see COMMENTS)
 * COMMENTS:
 *     Step 5 of Borland's scenario is wrong due to redefineClasses spec says:
 *     "The redefined method will be used on new invokes. If resetting these
 *     frames is desired, use ThreadReference.popFrames() with
 *     Method.isObsolete()."
 *     Test was fixed according to test bug:
 *     4778296 TEST_BUG: debuggee VM intemittently hangs after resuming
 *     - handling VMStartEvent was removed from the debugger part of the test
 *     - quit on VMDeathEvent was added to the event handling loop
 *     Test updated to wait for debugee VM exit:
 *     - standard method Debugee.endDebugee() is used instead of final Debugee.resume()
