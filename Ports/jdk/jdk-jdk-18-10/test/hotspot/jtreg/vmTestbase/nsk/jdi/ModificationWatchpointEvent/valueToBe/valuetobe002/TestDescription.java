 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/ModificationWatchpointEvent/valueToBe/valuetobe002.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *   This test exercises
 *      com.sun.jdi.event.ModificationWatchpointEvent.valueToBe() method.
 *    The test checks the following assertion:
 *      If any field of loaded class of target VM is assigned to new value
 *      which is equal to previous value, then Value reference returned
 *      by ModificationWatchpointEvent.valueToBe() is equal to one
 *      returned by Watchpoint.valueCurrent().
 *    A debugger class - nsk.jdi.ModificationWatchpointEvent.valueToBe.valuetobe001  ;
 *    a debuggee class - nsk.jdi.ModificationWatchpointEvent.valueToBe.valuetobe001a .
 *    The test uses supporting nsk/jdi/share classes for launching debuggee
 *    and for creating communication pipe between debugger and debuggee. The
 *    debugger and debugee communicates with special commands.
 *    The debugger creates ModificationWatchpointRequests to the fields defined
 *    in debuggee class.
 *    The debugger starts <Eventhandler> thread for listening events delivered
 *    from debuggee.
 *    Upon receiving <GO> command from debugger, the debuggee assignes every field
 *    to itself (i.e. the old and new values of the field are equal) and sends
 *    command <DONE>.
 *    The debugger switches to <EventHandler> to listen the event during the
 *    time  specified by <waittime> parameter. Then debugger shuts down debuggee
 *    by <QUIT> command.
 *    If debugger receives ModificationWatchpointEvent, it compares old and new
 *    values of field referenced in the event. The test fails if any of this
 *    these values are not equal. The test also fails if no
 *    ModificationWatchpointEvent was received.
 * COMMENTS
 *    Test fixed due to bug:
 *    4455653 VMDisconnectedException on resume
 * ----------
 *    I. To fix the bug 4505870, the following is done in file valuetobe001a.java:
 *    - assignments values to the fields lS0, lP0, lU0, lR0, lT0, and lV0
 *      are added (new lines 153-158).
 *    II. Several improvments:
 *    debugger:
 *    - line 129: check value is in requestsCount;
 *    - old line 37 removed;
 *    - check for all expected events received (lines 233-248) removed.
 *    debuggee:
 *    - line 25 removed.
 * ----------
 *    Standard method Debugee.endDebugee() is used instead of cleaning event queue on debuggee VM exit.
