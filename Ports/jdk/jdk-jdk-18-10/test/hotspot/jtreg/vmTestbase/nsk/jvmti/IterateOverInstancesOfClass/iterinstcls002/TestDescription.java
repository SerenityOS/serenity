 * @test
 *
 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jvmti/IterateOverInstancesOfClass/iterinstcls002.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jvmti, noras]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *     This JVMTI test exercises JVMTI heap function IterateOverInstancesOfClass().
 *     This test checks that IterateOverInstancesOfClass() function
 *     with JVMTI_HEAP_OBJECT_TAGGED filter iterates over all tagged
 *     instances of the tested class even is they are not reachable;
 *     and passes correct values to the callback.
 *     The test creates and tags the following tested objects:
 *         root object                     - root object with 2 chains
 *         chain of reachable objects      - tagged/untagged objects to be iterated
 *         chain of unreachable objects    - tagged objects to be iterated or GC'ed
 *     The test marks reachable objects with positive tags and
 *     unreachable objects with negative tags.
 *     Also each object in reachable chain is marked with zero tag
 *     (i.e., left untagged).
 *     Unreachable objects are monitored for OBJECT_FREE event to know
 *     if they were not iterated because of garbage collected.
 *     Local JNI references are explicitely deleted to ensure them
 *     not to affect the objects' reachability.
 *     The test supports the following special options:
 *         objects=<number>
 *             - number of objects in each objects chain
 *         info=[none|all|objref|stackref|heaproot|heapobj]
 *             - print trace message for each invocation of particular callback
 * COMMENTS
 *     Fixed according to 4960375 bug.
 *         The test updated to match new JVMTI spec 0.2.94.
 *     Fixed the 5005389 bug.
