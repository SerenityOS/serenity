 * @test
 *
 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/Event/_itself_/event002.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *     The test checks up on the JDI interface
 *     com.sun.jdi.event.Event.
 *     A debugger part of the test creates several AccessWatchpointRequests,
 *     and then it verifies that appropriate events will be generated
 *     by a target VM. After that, the debugger removes the list of
 *     the event requests via deleteEventRequests() call. Finally,
 *     the test checks that the events which corresponding requests
 *     have been deleted, are not generated by the target VM.
 * COMMENTS
 *     The test was updated due to the bug 4455653.
 *     --------------------------------------------
 *     To fix the bug 4509034,
 *     the check if
 *                  vm.canWatchFieldAccess() == true
 *     is added to the beginning of the test.
 *     --------------------------------------------
 *     To fix the bug 4615225,
 *     the test suite was moved here.
 *     --------------------------------------------
 *     Test updated to prevent possible VMDisconnectedException on VMDeathEvent:
 *     - quit on VMDeathEvent added to events handling loop
 *     Fixed according to 6290118 bug.
