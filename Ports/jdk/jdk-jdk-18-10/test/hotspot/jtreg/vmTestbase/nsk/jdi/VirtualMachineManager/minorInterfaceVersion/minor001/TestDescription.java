 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     The test for the implementation of an object of the type
 *     VirtualMachineManager.
 *     The test checks up that a result of the method
 *     com.sun.jdi.VirtualMachineManager. minorInterfaceVersion()
 *     complies with its spec:
 *     public int minorInterfaceVersion()
 *     Returns the minor version number of the JDI interface.
 *     See VirtualMachine.version() target VM version
 *     and information and VirtualMachine.description() more version information.
 *     Returns: the integer minor version number
 *     In case of error the test produces the return value 97 and
 *     a corresponding error message(s).
