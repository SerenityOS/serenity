 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jvmti/MonitorWaited/monitorwaited001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jvmti, noras]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *     The test exercises JVMTI event callback function
 *         MonitorWaited(jni_env, thread, object, timed_out).
 *     The test checks if the thread, object, and timed_out parameters of
 *     the function contain expected values for callback when a thread finishes
 *     waiting on an object.
 * COMMENTS
 *     The test updated to match new JVMTI spec 0.2.90:
 *     - change signature of agentProc function
 *       and save JNIEnv pointer now passed as argument.
 *
