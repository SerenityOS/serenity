 *
 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jvmti/MonitorContendedEnter/mcontenter001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jvmti, noras]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *     The test exercises JVMTI event callback function
 *         MonitorContendedEnter(jni_env, thread, object).
 *     The test checks if the thread and object parameters of the function
 *     contain expected values for callback when a thread is attemping
 *     to enter a Java language monitor already acquired by another thread.
 * COMMENTS
 *     The test updated to match new JVMTI spec 0.2.90:
 *     - change signature of agentProc function
 *       and save JNIEnv pointer now passed as argument.
 *     1000 ms of sleep added to main thread to reduce probability of bad racing.
