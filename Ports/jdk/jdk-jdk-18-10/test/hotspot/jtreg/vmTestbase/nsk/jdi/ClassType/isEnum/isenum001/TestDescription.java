 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/ClassType/isEnum/isenum001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *  A test for isEnum() method of ClassType interface.
 *  The test checks if the method returns true for any
 *  mirrored enum type
 *  The test consists of a debugger program (isenum001.java)
 *  and debuggee application (isenum001a.java).
 *  Package name is nsk.jdi.ClassType.isEnum .
 *  The test works as follows.
 *  The debugger uses nsk.jdi.share framework classes to
 *  establish connection with debuggee. The debugger and debuggee
 *  synchronize with each other using special commands over
 *  communication channel provided by framework classes.
 *  Upon receiving the signal of readiness from debuggee,
 *  the debugger calls isEnum() method for each field
 *  of enum type declared in isenum001a class.
 *  The test fails if the method returned false once or more.
 * COMMENTS:
 *  5029502 TEST_BUG: jdi tests against enum should not use abstract
 *          modifier
