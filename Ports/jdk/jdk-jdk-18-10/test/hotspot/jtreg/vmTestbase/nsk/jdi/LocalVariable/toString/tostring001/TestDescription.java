 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/LocalVariable/toString/tostring001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *  The test for public toString() method of an implementing class of
 *  com.sun.jdi.LocalVariable interface.
 *  The test checks an assertion:
 *     In conformity with the contract for java.lang.Object.toString(),
 *     the overrided method returns representing non-empty string for
 *     a LocalVariable object of a debuggee's local variable.
 * COMMENTS:
 *  The test is aimed to increase jdi source code coverage and checks
 *  the code which was not yet covered by previous tests for LocalVariable
 *  interface. The coverage analysis was done for jdk1.4.0-b92 build.
