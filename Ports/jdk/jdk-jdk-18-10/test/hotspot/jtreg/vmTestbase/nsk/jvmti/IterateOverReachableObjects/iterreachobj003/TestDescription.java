 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jvmti/IterateOverReachableObjects/iterreachobj003.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jvmti, noras]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *     This test checks if the following functions:
 *         CreateRawMonitor
 *         DestroyRawMonitor
 *         RawMonitorEnter
 *         RawMonitorExit
 *         RawMonitorWait
 *         RawMonitorNotify
 *         RawMonitorNotifyAll
 *         DestroyRawMonitor
 *     may be called in the callbacks of IterateOverReachableObjects
 *     function as it is specified for raw monitor functions:
 *        This function may be called from the callbacks to the Heap
 *        iteration functions, or from the event handles for the
 *        GarbageCollectionStart, GarbageCollectionFinish, and
 *        ObjectFree events.
 *     The test defines jvmtiHeapRootCallback, jvmtiStackReferenceCallback
 *     jvmtiObjectReferenceCallback callbacks which invokes the checked
 *     raw monitor functions.
 *     Then IterateOverReachableObjects function is invoked with the
 *     defined callbacks.
