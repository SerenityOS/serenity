 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/VirtualMachine/dispose/dispose001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     The test for the implementation of an object of the type
 *     VirtualMachine.
 *     The test checks up that a result of the method
 *     com.sun.jdi.VirtualMachine.dispose()
 *     complies with its spec:
 *     public void dispose()
 *     Invalidates this virtual machine mirror.
 *     The communication channel to the target VM is closed, and
 *     the target VM prepares to accept another subsequent connection from
 *     this debugger or another debugger, including the following tasks:
 *       All event requests are cancelled.
 *       All threads suspended by suspend() or by ThreadReference.suspend()
 *         are resumed as many times as necessary for them to run.
 *       Garbage collection is re-enabled in all cases where
 *         it was disabled through ObjectReference.disableCollection().
 *     Any current method invocations executing in the target VM are continued
 *     after the disconnection. Upon completion of any such method invocation,
 *     the invoking thread continues from the location where
 *     it was originally stopped.
 *     Resources originating in this VirtualMachine (ObjectReferences,
 *     ReferenceTypes, etc.) will become invalid.
 *     The test checks up that after call to VirtualMachine.dispose(),
 *     the communication channel is closed, hence,
 *     the VirtualMachine object becomes invalid.
 *     The test works as follows:
 *     The debugger program - nsk.jdi.VirtualMachine.dispose.dispose001;
 *     the debuggee program - nsk.jdi.VirtualMachine.dispose.dispose001a.
 *     Using nsk.jdi.share classes,
 *     the debugger gets the debuggee running on another JavaVM,
 *     creates the object debuggee.VM,
 *     establishes a pipe with the debuggee program, and then
 *     send to the programm commands, to which the debuggee replies
 *     via the pipe. Upon getting reply,
 *     the debugger calls corresponding debuggee.VM methods to get
 *     needed data and compares the data got to the data expected.
 *     In case of error the test produces the return value 97 and
 *     a corresponding error message(s).
 *     Otherwise, the test is passed and produces
 *     the return value 95 and no message.
