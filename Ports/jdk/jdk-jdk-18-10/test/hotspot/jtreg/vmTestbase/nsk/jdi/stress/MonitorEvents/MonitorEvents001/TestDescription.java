 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *         This is stress test for following jdi events and event requests:
 *             - MonitorContendedEnteredRequest/MonitorContendedEnteredEvent
 *             - MonitorContendedEnterRequest/MonitorContendedEnterEvent
 *             - MonitorWaitRequest/MonitorWaitEvent
 *             - MonitorWaitedRequest/MonitorWaitedEvent
 *         Debugger forces debuggee generate several thousands of monitor events and checks that all events was received and contain
 *         correct information.
 *         Test executes class nsk.share.jdi.StressTestTemplate which uses JDI events testing
 *         framework based on classes from package nsk.share.jdi.*.
 *         This framework uses following scenario:
 *             - debugger VM forces debuggee VM to create number of objects which should generate events during test
 *             - debuggee performs event generation and stop at breakpoint, all event generators save information about generated events
 *             - debugger reads data saved by debuggee's event generators and checks is only expected events was generated
 *         Stress test template allows to specify number of events which should be generated during test execution(parameter -eventsNumber)
 *         and number of threads which simultaneously generate events (parameter -threadsNumber).
 *         This test set eventsNumber to 500 and threadsNumber to 1, but because of framework design each requested
 *         MonitorEnterEvent and MonitorEnteredEvent should be generated in 3 different way(through synchronized block, synchronized method
 *         and JNI MonitorEnter), and by 3 different threads, so actual number of this events is (eventsNumber * 9) and
 *         actual number of threads generating this events is (threadsNumber * 3).
 *         MonitorWait and MonitorWaited events are generated by 3 different threads and each MonitorWaited event should be generated for 4 cases:
 *         thread exits from wait() after timeout, waiting thread is waked up with notify() or notifyAll(), or waiting thread
 *         is interrupted with interrupt(), so actual number of this events is (eventsNumber * 12), and actual number of threads generating this events is (threadsNumber * 3).
