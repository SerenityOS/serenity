 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/monitoring/stress/classload/unload005.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [stress, monitoring, nonconcurrent, noJFR]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *     The test checks up getAllClasses(), getLoadedClassCount(),
 *     getTotalLoadedClassCount(), getUnloadedClassCount() methods when one
 *     class is unloaded by 100 loaders, which are the instances of the same
 *     ClassLoader class.
 *     Access to the management metrics is accomplished through the MBeanServer.
 *     The unload005 test is performed for the ClassLoadingMBean interface under
 *     DEFAULT implementation of MBean server.
