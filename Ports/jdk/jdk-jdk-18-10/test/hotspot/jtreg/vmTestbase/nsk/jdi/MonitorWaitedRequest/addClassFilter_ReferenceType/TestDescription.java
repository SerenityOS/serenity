 * DESCRIPTION
 *         The test checks up that a result of the method com.sun.jdi.MonitorWaitedRequest.addClassFilter(ReferenceType referenceType)
 *         complies with its spec:
 *         "Restricts the events generated by this request to be the preparation of the given reference type and any subtypes.
 *         An event will be generated for any prepared reference type that can be safely cast to the given reference type."
 *         Test also checks that received com.sun.jdi.MonitorWaitedEvent complies with its spec and contain correct data.
 *         Test uses 2 event filters:
 *                 - add to request filter for class which has subclass (expect events for class and its subclasses)
 *                 - add to request filter for class whiteout subclasses
 *         MonitorWaited events are generated for 4 cases:
 *                 - waiting thread exits from wait() after timeout
 *                 - another thread wakes up waiting thread using notify() method
 *                 - another thread wakes up waiting thread using notifyAll() method
 *                 - another thread interrupts waiting thread using interrupt() method
 *         Test executes class nsk.share.jdi.ClassExclusionFilterTest which uses JDI events testing
 *         framework based on classes from package nsk.share.jdi.*.
 *         This framework uses following scenario:
 *                 - debugger VM forces debugge VM to create number of objects which should generate events during test
 *                 - if any event filters are used each generating event object is checked is this object accepted by all filters,
 *                 if object was accepted it should save information about all generated events and this information is available for debugger
 *                 - debuggee performs event generation and stop at breakpoint
 *                 - debugger reads data saved by debuggee's event generators and checks is only expected events was generated
 *         In addition to the main scenario tests using event filters also check following cases:
 *                 - attempt to add filter to enabled or deleted request throws 'InvalidRequestStateException'
 *                 - corresponding method EventRequestManager.xxxRequests() returns created event request
