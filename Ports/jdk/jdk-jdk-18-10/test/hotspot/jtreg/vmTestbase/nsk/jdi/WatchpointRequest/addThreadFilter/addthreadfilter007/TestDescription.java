 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/WatchpointRequest/addThreadFilter/addthreadfilter007.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     The test for the implementation of an object of the type
 *     WatchpointRequest.
 *     The test checks up that a result of the method
 *     com.sun.jdi.WatchpointRequest.addThreadFilter()
 *     complies with its spec:
 *     public void addThreadFilter(ThreadReference thread)
 *      Restricts the events generated by this request to those in the given thread.
 *      Parameters: thread - the thread to filter on.
 *      Throws: InvalidRequestStateException -
 *              if this request is currently enabled or has been deleted.
 *              Filters may be added only to disabled requests.
 *     The test checks up on the following assertion:
 *        Restricts the events generated by this request to those in the given thread.
 *     The tested Request is AccessWatchpointRequest and
 *     the cases to test include re-invocations of the method
 *     addThreadFilter() on the same AccessWatchpointRequest object.
 *     There are two AccessWatchpointRequests to check as follows:
 *     (1) For AccessWatchpointRequest2, both invocations are with different
 *         ThreadReferences restricting one AccessWatchpoint event to two threads.
 *         The test expects no AccessWatchpoint event will be received.
 *     (2) For AccessWatchpointRequest1, both invocations are with the same
 *         ThreadReference restricting one AccessWatchpoint event to one thread.
 *         The test expects this AccessWatchpoint event will be received.
 *     The test works as follows:
 *     The debugger program - nsk.jdi.WatchpointRequest.addThreadFilter.addthreadfilter007;
 *     the debuggee program - nsk.jdi.WatchpointRequest.addThreadFilter.addthreadfilter007a.
 *     Using nsk.jdi.share classes,
 *     the debugger gets the debuggee running on another JavaVM,
 *     creates the object debuggee.VM, and waits for VMStartEvent.
 *     Upon getting the debuggee VM started,
 *     the debugger calls corresponding debuggee.VM methods to get
 *     needed data and to perform checks.
 *     In case of error the test produces the return value 97 and
 *     a corresponding error message(s).
 *     Otherwise, the test is passed and produces
 *     the return value 95 and no message.
 * COMMENTS:
 *     4930911 TEST_BUG: filter_rt006 debuggee has a race
