 * VM Testbase keywords: [jpda, jvmti, noras, feature_282, vm6, jdk]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * Description :
 *     Test tries to load jvmti agent to the VM after the VM has started using
 *     Attach API (com.sun.tools.attach).
 *     Test is based on the nsk.share.aod framework. In the terms of this framework
 *     java application running in the VM where agent is loaded to is called 'target application'.
 *     Test checks that agent receives events ThreadStart, ThreadEnd (these events are provoked
 *     by target application).
