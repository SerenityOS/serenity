 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jvmti/AddToBootstrapClassLoaderSearch/bootclssearch004.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jvmti, onload_only_logic, noras, no_cds]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *     This JVMTI test exercises JVMTI thread function AddToBootstrapClassLoaderSearch().
 *     This test checks that AddToBootstrapClassLoaderSearch() can add two segments
 *     to bootstrap class search path in OnLoad phase, and debuggee class will be
 *     loaded from the first segment even if it is found in the second segment too,
 *     The following checks are performed by the test:
 *         - AddToBootstrapClassLoaderSearch() adds two segments and returns
 *           no errors in OnLoad phase
 *         - debuggee class located by the first added segment will be loaded
 *         - debuggee class located by the second added segment will NOT be loaded
 *     There are two different implementations of debuggee class 'bootclssearch004'.
 *     Source of "positive" implementation is located in subdirectory 'newclass01'.
 *     It will be compiled to '$COMMON_CLASSES_LOCATION/newclass01', that will be
 *     added first to bootstrap class search path.
 *     This implementation returns PASS.
 *     Source of "negative" implementation is located in subdirectory 'newclass02'.
 *     It will be compiled to '$COMMON_CLASSES_LOCATION/newclass02', that will be
 *     added second to bootstrap class search path.
 *     This implementation returns FAIL.
 *     The agent adds both subdirectories to the bootstrap class search path
 *     in Agent_OnLoad(), and expects that positive implementation of debuggee class
 *     from the first added segment will be loaded and executed.
 *     If AddToBootstrapClassLoaderSearch() returns error in Agent_OnLoad(),
 *     then agent returns JNI_ERR and VM fails on initialization.
 *     If negative implementation of debuggee class is loaded and executed,
 *     then it returns FAIL and test fails with exit code 97.
 *     Otherwise, if both segments are successfully added and positive implementation
 *     of debuggee class is loaded and executed, then it returns PASS and test
 *     passes with exit code 95.
 * COMMENTS
 *     Made code cleanup: nsk/share/jvmti/AddToBootstrapClassLoaderSearch/bootclssearch_agent
 *                        agent is used now.
