 * @test

 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/VirtualMachine/topLevelThreadGroups/toplevelgroups001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     The test for the implementation of an object of the type
 *     VirtualMachine.
 *     The test checks up that a result of the method
 *     com.sun.jdi.VirtualMachine.topLevelThreadGroups()
 *     complies with its spec:
 *     public java.util.List topLevelThreadGroups()
 *     Returns each thread group which does not have a parent.
 *     For each top level thread group a ThreadGroupReference is
 *     placed in the returned list.
 *     This command may be used as the first step in building a tree (or trees)
 *     of the existing thread groups.
 *     Returns: a list of ThreadGroupReference objects,
 *              one for each top level thread group.
 *     The test works as follows:
 *     The debugger program - nsk.jdi.VirtualMachine.topLevelThreadGroups.toplevelgroups001;
 *     the debuggee program - nsk.jdi.VirtualMachine.topLevelThreadGroups.toplevelgroups001a.
 *     Using nsk.jdi.share classes,
 *     the debugger gets the debuggee running on another JavaVM,
 *     creates the object debuggee.VM,
 *     establishes a pipe with the debuggee program, and then
 *     send to the programm commands, to which the debuggee replies
 *     via the pipe. Upon getting reply,
 *     the debugger calls corresponding debuggee.VM methods to get
 *     needed data and compares the data got to the data expected.
 *     In case of error the test produces the return value 97 and
 *     a corresponding error message(s).
 *     Otherwise, the test is passed and produces
 *     the return value 95 and no message.
