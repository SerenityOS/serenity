 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdwp/Event/FIELD_ACCESS/fldaccess001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdwp]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *     This test performs checking for
 *         command set: Event
 *         command: Composite
 *         command set: EventRequest
 *         command: Set, Clear
 *         event kind: FIELD_ACCESS
 *     Test checks that
 *         1) debuggee successfully creates FIELD_ACCESS event request
 *            for particular static filed
 *         2) expected FIELD_ACCESS event is received when the thread
 *            accesses tested field into debuggee
 *         3) debuggee successfully removes event request
 *     Test consists of two compoments:
 *         debugger: fldaccess001
 *         debuggee: fldaccess001a
 *     First, debugger uses nsk.share support classes to launch debuggee,
 *     and obtains Transport object, that represents JDWP transport channel.
 *     Next, debugger waits for tested class loaded and obtains fieldID
 *     for tested static field and expected location of FIELD_ACCESS event.
 *     Then debugger waits for breakpoint is reached by a thread in
 *     debuggee makes request for FIELD_ACCESS event for known classID and
 *     fieldID.
 *     When event is received debugger checks if the received event is for
 *     expected request, class, thread, field and location, and has correct
 *     attributes. Then debugger removes event request.
 *     Finally, debugger disconnects debuggee, waits for it exited
 *     and exits too with proper exit code.
 * COMMENTS
 *     Test was fixed due to test bug:
 *     4797978 TEST_BUG: potential race condition in a number of JDWP tests
