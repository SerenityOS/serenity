 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/WatchpointEvent/object/object001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *    This test exercises
 *      com.sun.jdi.event.WatchpointEvent.object() method.
 *    The test checks the following assertion:
 *       method WatchpointEvent.object() returns
 *         correct ObjectReference for instance field and
 *         null for static field.
 *    A debugger class - nsk.jdi.WatchpointEvent.object.object001  ;
 *    a debuggee class - nsk.jdi.WatchpointEvent.object.object001a .
 *    The test uses supporting nsk/jdi/share classes for launching debuggee
 *    and for creating communication pipe between debugger and debuggee. The
 *    debugger and debugee communicates with special commands.
 *    The debugger creates WatchpointRequests to the fields defined
 *    in checked class.
 *    The debugger starts <Eventhandler> thread for listening events delivered
 *    from debuggee.
 *    Upon receiving <GO> command from debugger, the debuggee initializes its
 *    fields and sends command <DONE>.
 *    The debugger switches to <EventHandler> to listen the event during the
 *    time  specified by <waittime> parameter. Finally debugger shuts down debuggee
 *    by <QUIT> command.
 *    If debugger receives WatchpointEvent, it checks the assertion of the test.
 *    The test also fails if no WatchpointEvent was received.
 * COMMENTS
 *    Test fixed due to bug:
 *        4455653 VMDisconnectedException on resume
 *    Standard method Debugee.endDebugee() is used instead of cleaning
 *         event queue on debuggee VM exit.
