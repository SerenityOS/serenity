 * @test
 *
 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/Method/variables/variables002.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     The test for the implementation of an object of the type
 *     Method.
 *     The test checks up that a result of the method
 *     com.sun.jdi.Method.variables()
 *     complies with its spec:
 *     public java.util.List variables()
 *                          throws AbsentInformationException
 *     Returns a list containing each LocalVariable declared in this method.
 *     The list includes any variable declared in any scope within the method.
 *     It may contain multiple variables of the same name declared within
 *     disjoint scopes.
 *     Arguments are considered local variables and will be present in
 *     the returned list.
 *     Returns: the list of LocalVariable objects which mirror local variables
 *              declared in this method in the target VM.
 *              If there are no local variables, a zero-length list is returned.
 *     Throws: AbsentInformationException -
 *             if there is no variable information for this method.
 *             NativeMethodException -
 *             if this operation is attempted for a native method.
 *     when a debugged program is compiled without the '-g' option,
 *     hence, AbsentInformationException is expected.
 *     The test works as follows:
 *     The debugger program - nsk.jdi.Method.variables.variables002;
 *     the debuggee program - nsk.jdi.Method.variables.variables002a.
 *     Using nsk.jdi.share classes,
 *     the debugger gets the debuggee running on another JavaVM,
 *     creates the object debuggee.VM,
 *     establishes a pipe with the debuggee program, and then
 *     send to the programm commands, to which the debuggee replies
 *     via the pipe. Upon getting reply,
 *     the debugger calls corresponding debuggee.VM methods to get
 *     needed data and compares the data got to the data expected.
 *     In case of error the test produces the return value 97 and
 *     a corresponding error message(s).
 *     Otherwise, the test is passed and produces
 *     the return value 95 and no message.
