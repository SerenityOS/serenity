 * @test
 * @key stress
 *
 * @summary converted from VM testbase nsk/stress/stack/stack010.
 * VM testbase keywords: [stress, stack, nonconcurrent]
 * VM testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *     This test provokes multiple stack overflows in the multiple
 *     threads -- by invoking static recursive method for the given
 *     fixed depth of recursion (though, for a large depth).
 *     This test measures a number of recursive invocations until
 *     stack overflow, and then tries to provoke similar stack overflows
 *     10 times in each of 10 threads. Each provocation consists of
 *     invoking that recursive method for the given fixed depth
 *     of invocations which is 10 times that depth measured before.
 *     The test is deemed passed, if VM have not crashed, and
 *     if exception other than due to stack overflow was not
 *     thrown.
 * COMMENTS
 *     This test crashes HS versions 2.0, 1.3, 1.4 on Win32 and Solaris
 *     platforms.
 *     See the bug:
 *     4366625 (P4/S4) multiple stack overflow causes HS crash
 *
 * @requires vm.opt.DeoptimizeALot != true
 * @run main/othervm/timeout=900 nsk.stress.stack.stack010
