 * @test
 *
 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/StepRequest/addInstanceFilter/instancefilter001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     The test for the implementation of an object of the type
 *     StepRequest.
 *     The test checks up that a result of the method
 *     com.sun.jdi.StepRequest.addInstanceFilter()
 *     complies with its spec:
 *     public void addInstanceFilter(ObjectReference instance)
 *      Restricts the events generated by this request to those in which
 *      the currently executing instance is the object specified.
 *      Not all targets support this operation.
 *      Use VirtualMachine.canUseInstanceFilters() to determine
 *      if the operation is supported.
 *      Parameters: instance - the object which must be the current instance
 *                             in order to pass this filter.
 *      Throws: UnsupportedOperationException -
 *              if the target virtual machine does not support this operation.
 *              InvalidRequestStateException -
 *              if this request is currently enabled or has been deleted.
 *              Filters may be added only to disabled requests.
 *     The test checks up on the following assertion:
 *         Restricts the events generated by this request to those in which
 *         the currently executing instance is the object specified.
 *     The cases to test include invocations of the method addInstanceFilter() on
 *     two StepRequest objects with defferent array element (instances) arquments.
 *     (1) For StepRequest2, a testing thread will not execute an ObjectRefernce
 *         instance used as the filter;
 *         hence, the test expects this Step event will not be received.
 *     (2) For StepRequest1, a testing thread will do execute an ObjectRefernce
 *         instance used as the filter;
 *         hence, the test expects this Step event will be received.
 *     The test works as follows:
 *     The debugger program - nsk.jdi.StepRequest.addInstanceFilter.instancefilter001;
 *     the debuggee program - nsk.jdi.StepRequest.addInstanceFilter.instancefilter001a.
 *     Using nsk.jdi.share classes,
 *     the debugger gets the debuggee running on another JavaVM,
 *     creates the object debuggee.VM, and waits for VMStartEvent.
 *     Upon getting the debuggee VM started,
 *     the debugger calls corresponding debuggee.VM methods to get
 *     needed data and to perform checks.
 *     In case of error the test produces the return value 97 and
 *     a corresponding error message(s).
 *     Otherwise, the test is passed and produces
 *     the return value 95 and no message.
 * COMMENTS:
 *     The test was fixed due to bug:
 *       4687906 TEST_BUG: some tests for jdi StepRequest are invalid
 *     Modified due to fix of the bug:
 *       4930911 TEST_BUG: filter_rt006 debuggee has a race
