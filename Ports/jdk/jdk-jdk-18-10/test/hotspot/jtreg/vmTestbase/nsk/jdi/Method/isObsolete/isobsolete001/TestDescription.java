 * @test
 *
 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/Method/isObsolete/isobsolete001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [jpda, jdi, redefine]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     The test for the implementation of an object of the type
 *     Method.
 *     The test checks up that a result of the method
 *     com.sun.jdi.Method.isObsolete()
 *     complies with its spec:
 *     public boolean isObsolete()
 *      Determine if this method is obsolete.
 *      Returns: true if this method has been replaced by
 *               a non-equivalent method using
 *               VirtualMachine.redefineClasses(java.util.Map).
 *     The test checks that isObsolete() returns false if
 *     the tested method was redefined with itself which is certainly equivalent.
 *     The test works as follows:
 *     The debugger program - nsk.jdi.Method.isObsolete.isobsolete001;
 *     the debuggee program - nsk.jdi.Method.isObsolete.isobsolete001a.
 *     Using nsk.jdi.share classes,
 *     the debugger gets the debuggee running on another JavaVM,
 *     creates the object debuggee.VM, and waits for VMStartEvent.
 *     Upon getting the debuggee VM started,
 *     the debugger calls corresponding debuggee.VM methods to get
 *     needed data and to perform checks.
 *     In case of error the test produces the return value 97 and
 *     a corresponding error message(s).
 *     Otherwise, the test is passed and produces
 *     the return value 95 and no message.
 * COMMENTS:
 *     The test suite contains
 *     the precompiled class file isobsolete001b.klass .
 *     Its source file is isobsolete001b.java .
 *     The test was modified die to fix of the bug:
 *     4514956 Method.isObsolete() returns false for redefined method
 *     Test was updated according to rfe:
 *     4691123 TEST: some jdi tests contain precompiled .klass files undes SCCS.
 *     isobsolete001b.java was copied into newclass directory and the precompiled
 *     class file is created during test base build process.
 *     Test fixed according to test bug:
 *     4798088 TEST_BUG: setBreakpoint() method depends of the locations implementation
 *     - using standard Debugee.makeBreakpoint() method
 *     - adjusting source line numbers used for setting breakpoint
