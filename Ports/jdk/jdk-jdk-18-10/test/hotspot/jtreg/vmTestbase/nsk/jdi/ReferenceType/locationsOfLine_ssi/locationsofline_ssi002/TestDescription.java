 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/ReferenceType/locationsOfLine_ssi/locationsofline_ssi002.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *     This test checks that the JDI method
 *        com.sun.jdi.ReferenceType.locationsOfLine(String,String,int)
 *     properly returns an empty list for arrays (ArrayType) primitive
 *     classes, and for interfaces (InterfaceType) if the interface has
 *     no executable code in its class initialization at the specified line
 *     number.
 *     Debugger part of it attempts to get locations that map to the debuggee
 *     field values/type declaration, which themselves are:
 *     primitive classes, arrays of primitive types and classes, and finally,
 *     an interface type.
