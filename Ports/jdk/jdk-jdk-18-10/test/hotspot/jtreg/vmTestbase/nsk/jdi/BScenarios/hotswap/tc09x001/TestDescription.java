 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/BScenarios/hotswap/tc09x001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdi, redefine]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     This test is from the group of so-called Borland's scenarios and
 *     implements the following test case:
 *         Suite 3 - Hot Swap
 *         Test case:      TC9
 *         Description:    Breakpoints updated correctly
 *         Steps:          1.Set breakpoint at lines 36 and 39
 *                            (printing 1 and 4)
 *                         2.Debug Main
 *                            X. Stops on line 36
 *                         3.Delete line 37
 *                         4.Smart Swap
 *                            X. Breakpoints still set and valid at 36
 *                            and 38
 *                         5.Resume
 *                            X. Stops on line 38
 *     The description was drown up according to steps under JBuilder.
 *     Of course, the test has own line numbers and method/class names and
 *     works as follow:
 *     When the test is starting debugee, debugger sets breakpoints at
 *     the 47th and 49th line (method method_C).
 *     After the first breakpoint is reached, debugger redefines debugee
 *     deleting 48th line and resumes debugee. No breakpoints are
 *     expected anymore.
 * COMMENTS:
 *     Last step from scenarion description (stopping on line 38) is wrong
 *     of because JVMDI spec (Redefine Classes ) says:"...All breakpoints
 *     in the class are cleared."
 *     Test was fixed according to test bug:
 *     4778296 TEST_BUG: debuggee VM intemittently hangs after resuming
 *     - handling VMStartEvent was removed from the debugger part of the test
 *     - quit on VMDeathEvent was added to the event handling loop
 *     Test updated to wait for debugee VM exit:
 *     - standard method Debugee.endDebugee() is used instead of final Debugee.resume()
 *
