 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdwp/Method/Bytecodes/bytecodes001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdwp]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *     This test performs checking for
 *         command set: Method
 *         command: Bytecodes
 *     Test checks that debugee accept the command packet and
 *     replies with correct reply packet.
 *     Test consists of two compoments:
 *         debugger: bytecodes001
 *         debuggee: bytecodes001a
 *     First, debugger uses nsk.share support classes to launch debuggee
 *     and obtain Transport object, that represents JDWP transport channel.
 *     Also communication channel (IOPipe) is established between
 *     debugger and debuggee to exchange with synchronization signals.
 *     Next, debugger obtains classID and methodID for the tested class
 *     and method from debuggee.
 *     Then, debugger creates command packet for Method.Bytecodes command
 *     with the found classID and methodID as arguments, writes packet to
 *     the transport channel, and waits for a reply packet.
 *     When reply packet is received, debugger parses the packet structure
 *     and extracts all bytes of bytecode for requested method.
 *     Finally, debugger sends debuggee signal to quit, waits for it exits
 *     and exits too with the proper exit code.
