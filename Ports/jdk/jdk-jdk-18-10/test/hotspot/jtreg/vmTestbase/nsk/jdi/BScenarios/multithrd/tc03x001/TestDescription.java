 * @test
 *
 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/BScenarios/multithrd/tc03x001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     This test is from the group of so-called Borland's scenarios and
 *     implements the following test case:
 *         Suite 2 - Breakpoints (multiple threads)
 *         Test case:      TC3
 *         Description:    Exception breakpoint
 *         Steps:          1.Set caught exception breakpoint on class
 *                           javax.sound.midi.MidiUnavailableException
 *                         2.Debug Main
 *                           X. Stops on line 42 in Main.java
 *     The description was drown up according to steps under JBuilder.
 *     Of course, the test has own line numbers and method/class names and
 *     works as follow:
 *     When the test is starting debugee, debugger creates ExceptionRequest.
 *     After ExceptionEvent arrived, debugger checks line number of one's
 *     location. It should be 74th line, that is throwing tc03x001aException.
 *     Every thread must generate ExceptionEvent.
 *     In case, when at least one event doesn't arrive during waittime
 *     interval or line number of event is wrong, test fails.
 * COMMENTS:
 *     Test was fixed according to test bug:
 *     4778296 TEST_BUG: debuggee VM intemittently hangs after resuming
 *     - handling VMStartEvent was removed from the debugger part of the test
 *     - quit on VMDeathEvent was added to the event handling loop
 *     Test fixed according to test bug:
 *     4804095 TEST_BUG: potential race condition with loading classes in JDI tests
 *     - launching debuggee by prepareDebugee() replaced with bindToDebugee()
 *       to exclude first IOPipe communication
 *     - making ClassPrepareRequest moved to begin (right after debuggee started)
 *     - making ExceptionRequest moved to handling ClassPrepareEvent
 *     - handling events moved to a separate thread
 *     - removed extra IOPipe communication points to make algorithm more clear
