 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/BScenarios/hotswap/tc04x001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdi, redefine]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     This test is from the group of so-called Borland's scenarios and
 *     implements the following test case:
 *         Suite 3 - Hot Swap
 *         Test case:      TC4
 *         Description:    Before point of execution, different method
 *         Steps:          1.Set breakpoint at line 30 (call to c()
 *                            from b())
 *                         2.Debug Main
 *                         3.Insert as first line in a():
 *                            System.err.println("foo");
 *                         4.Smart Swap
 *                         5.Set Smart PopFrame to beginging of
 *                            method a()
 *                         6.Resume
 *                            X. Prints out "foo" and hits breakpoint
 *                            at line 30
 *                         7.Resume
 *                            X. Print numbers
 *     The description was drown up according to steps under JBuilder.
 *     Of course, the test has own line numbers and method/class names and
 *     works as follow:
 *     When the test is starting debugee, debugger sets breakpoint at
 *     the 43th line (method "method_B").
 *     After the breakpoint is reached, debugger:
 *         - redefines debugee adding a new line into "method_A",
 *         - pops frames at beginning of "method_A"
 *     and resumes debugee.
 *     It is expected the new code will be actual after the redefining and
 *     it doesn't hit breakpoint (see COMMENTS).
 * COMMENTS:
 *     In step 6 waiting breakpoint is wrong due to JVMDI Redefine
 *     Classes spec says:"...All breakpoints in the class are cleared."
 *     Test was fixed according to test bug:
 *     4778296 TEST_BUG: debuggee VM intemittently hangs after resuming
 *     - handling VMStartEvent was removed from the debugger part of the test
 *     - quit on VMDeathEvent was added to the event handling loop
 *     Test updated to wait for debugee VM exit:
 *     - standard method Debugee.endDebugee() is used instead of final Debugee.resume()
