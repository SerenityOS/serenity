 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/TypeComponent/isSynthetic/issynthetic001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *     This test checks the isSynthetic() method of TypeComponent interface of
 *     com.sun.jdi package.
 *     The method spec:
 *     public boolean isSynthetic()
 *     Determines if this TypeComponent is synthetic. Synthetic members are
 *     generated by the compiler and are not present in the source code for the
 *     containing class.
 *     Not all target VMs support this query. See
 *     VirtualMachine.canGetSyntheticAttribute() to determine if the operation
 *     is supported.
 *     Returns: true if this type component is synthetic; false otherwise.
 *     Throws: java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException - if the target VM cannot
 *             provide information on synthetic attributes.
 *     nsk/jdi/TypeComponent/isSynthetic/issynthetic001 checks assertions:
 *     public java.lang.String isSynthetic()
 *     1. Returns true if the operation is supported and the field is synthetic;
 *     2. Returns false if the operation is supported and the field is not
 *        present in the source code for the containing class;
 *     3. Throws java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException if the target VM cannot
 *        provide information on synthetic attributes
 *        (VirtualMachine.canGetSyntheticAttribute() is false).
 *     4. Does not throw java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException if the target
 *        VM provides information on synthetic attributes
 *        (VirtualMachine.canGetSyntheticAttribute() is true).
 *     There are classes ClassToCheck and NestedClass declared within
 *     ClassToCheck in debugee. So synthetic field (reference to ClassToCheck)
 *     must exist in NestedClass.
 *     Debugger gets all fields from NestedClass, gets isSynthetic() value.
 *     If VirtualMachine.canGetSyntheticAttribute() is false then exception
 *     java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException must be thrown. Otherwise
 *     exception is not thrown.
 *     Then test tries to find field's name in list of fileds that are present
 *     in the source code. If field is not found, then isSynthetic() value
 *     expects to be true, otherwise isSynthetic() value expects to be false.
