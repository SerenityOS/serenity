 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/IntegerValue/equals/equals002.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     The test for the boundary value of the parameters.
 *     The test checks up that the method
 *     com.sun.jdi.IntegerValue.equals(Object)
 *     correctly works for the boundary value of parameter, throws described
 *     exceptions and complies with its spec:
 *     public boolean equals(Object obj)
 *      Compares the specified Object with this IntegerValue for equality.
 *      Overrides:
 *          equals in class Object
 *      Returns:
 *          true if the Object is an IntegerValue and if applying "==" to the
 *          two mirrored primitives would evaluate to true; false otherwise.
 *     The test check up case when parameter has boundary values of primitive
 *     types. Also, case when parameter is <null> considered.
 *     No exceptions are expected.
 *     In case of error the test produces the return value 97 and a corresponding
 *     error message(s). Otherwise, the test is passed and produces the return
 *     value 95 and no message.
