/**
 * The test for the implementation of an object of the type
 * WatchpointRequest.
 *
 * The test checks that results of the method
 * <code>com.sun.jdi.WatchpointRequest.addInstanceFilter()</code>
 * complies with its spec.
 *
 * The test checks up on the following assertion:
 *    Restricts the events generated by this request to those in which
 *    the currently executing instance is the object specified.
 * This request is ModificationWatchpointRequest.
 * The cases to test includes re-invocation of the method
 * addInstanceFilter() on the same ModificationWatchpointRequest object.
 * There are two ModificationWatchpointRequests to check as follows:
 * (1) For ModificationWatchpointRequest2, both invocations are with different
 * ObjectReferences restricting one ModificationWatchpoint event to two objects.
 * The test expects no ModificationWatchpoint event will be received.
 * (2) For ModificationWatchpointRequest1, both invocations are with the same
 * ObjectReference restricting one ModificationWatchpoint event to one object.
 * The test expects this ModificationWatchpoint event will be received.
 *
 * The test works as follows.
 * - The debugger resumes the debuggee and waits for the BreakpointEvent.
 * - The debuggee creates two threads, thread1 and thread2, and invokes
 *   the methodForCommunication to be suspended and
 *   to inform the debugger with the event.
 * - Upon getting the BreakpointEvent, the debugger
 *   - sets up ModificationWatchpointRequests 1&2 within the method
 *     in the class instancefilter008aTestClass which will be calling by both threads,
 *   - restricts the ModificationWatchpointRequest1 to the tread1 and
 *     to the array elements #0 & #0 calling only within thread1,
 *   - restricts the ModificationWatchpointRequest2 to the thread2 and
 *     the array elements #0 & #1 calling within thread1 and thread2,
 *   - resumes debuggee's main thread, and
 *   - waits for the event.
 * - Debuggee's main thread starts both threads.
 * - Upon getting the event, the debugger performs the checks required.
