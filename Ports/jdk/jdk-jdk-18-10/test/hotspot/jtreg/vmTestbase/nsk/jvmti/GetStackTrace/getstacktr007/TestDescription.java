 * DESCRIPTION
 *     The test exercises JVMTI function GetStackTrace via breakpoint
 *     and consequent class redefinition.
 *     The test starts a new thread, does some nested calls, stops at breakpoint,
 *     redefines the class and checks if the number of frames in the thread's
 *     stack is as expected and the function returns all the expected frames.
 * COMMENTS
 *     Ported from JVMDI.
