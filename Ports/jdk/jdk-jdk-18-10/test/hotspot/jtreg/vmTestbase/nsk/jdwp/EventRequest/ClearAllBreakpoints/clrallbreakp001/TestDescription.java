 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdwp/EventRequest/ClearAllBreakpoints/clrallbreakp001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdwp]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *     This test performs checking for
 *         command set: EventRequest
 *         command: ClearAllBreakpoints
 *     Test checks that debuggee accept tested command and replies
 *     with correct reply packet. Also test checks that no breakpoint
 *     events occures for previously created BREAKPOINT request.
 *     Test consists of two compoments:
 *         debugger: clrallbreakp001
 *         debuggee: clrallbreakp001a
 *     First, debugger uses nsk.share support classes to launch debuggee
 *     and obtain Transport object, that represents JDWP transport channel.
 *     Next, debugger waits for tested class loaded into debuggee and
 *     makes request for BREAKPOINT at method run().
 *     Then, debugger creates creates command packet for command
 *     EventRequest.ClearAllBreakpoints, sends it to debuggee, waits
 *     for reply packet and check that reply is correct and has no reply data.
 *     Then, debugger resumes debuggee and waits for an VM_DEATH event.
 *     If received event is BREAKPOINT event, debugger complains an error.
 *     Finally, debugger disconnectes debuggee, waits for it exits
 *     and exits too with proper exit code.
 * COMMENTS
 *     Test was fixed due to test bug:
 *     4797978 TEST_BUG: potential race condition in a number of JDWP tests
