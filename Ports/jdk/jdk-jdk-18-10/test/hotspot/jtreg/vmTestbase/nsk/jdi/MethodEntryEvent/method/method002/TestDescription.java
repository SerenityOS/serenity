 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/MethodEntryEvent/method/method002.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *    The test exercises
 *        com.sun.jdi.event.MethodEntryEvent.method() method.
 *    The test checks the following assertions:
 *        - MethodEntryEvent is received by debugger for requested
 *          method if this method is invoked by some executing thread
 *          in debugged VM;
 *        - received MethodEntryEvent has proper references to:
 *            method,
 *            debugged VM,
 *            executed thread,
 *            related MethodEntryRequest.
 *        - MethodEntryEvent is produced before any code of the
 *          method is executed.
 *    A debugger class - nsk.jdi.MethodEntryEvent.method.method002  ;
 *    a debuggee class - nsk.jdi.MethodEntryEvent.method.method002a .
 *    The test uses supporting nsk/share/jdi classes for launching debuggee
 *    and for creating communication pipe between debugger and debuggee. The
 *    debugger and debugee communicates with special commands.
 *    The debugger creates MethodEntryRequest filtered to <method001a> class.
 *    Also it sets two breakpoint in debuggee before and after invoking
 *    checked method <foo>.
 *    The debugger starts <EventHandler> thread for listening events delivered
 *    from debuggee.
 *    Upon receiving <GO> command from debugger, the debuggee creates variable
 *    of <method002child> class. This class implements abstract <foo()> method
 *    of <meythod002parent> class. The <foo()> method is invoked. The
 *    implementing method updates <counter> field of <method002child> class.
 *    The debugger switches to <EventHandler> to listen the event during the
 *    time specified by <waittime> parameter. When BreakpointEvent for the first
 *    breakpoint is received, MethodEntryRequest becomes enabled. <EventHandler>
 *    checks all received MetodEntryEvents until second breakpoint is reached
 *    and MethodEntryRequest becomes disabled.
 *    Each time the debugger receives MethodEntryEvent, it compares all refencies
 *    of this event ( <method>, <thread>, <request>, <virtualMachine> )
 *    with expected values. If the event belongs to <foo()> method, value
 *    of <flag> field is checked.
 *    Finally, debugger sends debuggee command QUIT and checks number of recieved
 *    events.
 *    The test fails if any of the checks failed.
 * COMMENTS
 *    Test fixed due to bugs:
 *      4455653 VMDisconnectedException on resume
 *      4433805 EventSet.resume() for VMStartEvent resumes thread suspended by breakpoint request
 *    Standard method Debugee.endDebugee() is used instead of cleaning event queue on debuggee VM exit.
 *    Test fixed according to test bug:
 *      4798088 TEST_BUG: setBreakpoint() method depends of the locations implementation
 *      - using standard Debugee.setBreakpoint() method for setting breakpoint
