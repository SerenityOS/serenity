     * the corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the
     * contents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this method
     * performs a "shallow copy" of this object, not a "deep copy" operation.
     * <p>
     * The class <tt>Object</tt> does not itself implement the interface

    /**
     * Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection
     * determines that there are no more references to the object.
     * A subclass overrides the <code>finalize</code> method to dispose of
     * system resources or to perform other cleanup.
     * <p>
     * The general contract of <tt>finalize</tt> is that it is invoked
     * if and when the Java<font size="-2"><sup>TM</sup></font> virtual
     * machine has determined that there is no longer any
     * means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has
     * not yet died, except as a result of an action taken by the
     * finalization of some other object or class which is ready to be
     * finalized. The <tt>finalize</tt> method may take any action, including
     * making this object available again to other threads; the usual purpose
     * of <tt>finalize</tt>, however, is to perform cleanup actions before
     * the object is irrevocably discarded. For example, the finalize method
     * for an object that represents an input/output connection might perform
     * explicit I/O transactions to break the connection before the object is
     * permanently discarded.
     * <p>
     * The <tt>finalize</tt> method of class <tt>Object</tt> performs no
     * special action; it simply returns normally. Subclasses of
     * <tt>Object</tt> may override this definition.
     * <p>
     * The Java programming language does not guarantee which thread will
     * invoke the <tt>finalize</tt> method for any given object. It is
     * guaranteed, however, that the thread that invokes finalize will not
     * be holding any user-visible synchronization locks when finalize is
     * invoked. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the finalize method,
     * the exception is ignored and finalization of that object terminates.
     * <p>
     * After the <tt>finalize</tt> method has been invoked for an object, no
     * further action is taken until the Java virtual machine has again
     * determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can
     * be accessed by any thread that has not yet died, including possible
     * actions by other objects or classes which are ready to be finalized,
     * at which point the object may be discarded.
     * <p>
     * The <tt>finalize</tt> method is never invoked more than once by a Java
     * virtual machine for any given object.
     * <p>
     * Any exception thrown by the <code>finalize</code> method causes
     * the finalization of this object to be halted, but is otherwise
     * ignored.
     *
     * @throws Throwable the <code>Exception</code> raised by this method
