 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/ExceptionEvent/_itself_/exevent004.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *     The test checks that uncaught exception event is properly reported
 *     by the debugger. It calls
 *     com.sun.jdi.request.EventRequestManager.createExceptionRequest()
 *     method with true value of boolean parameter notifyUncaught.
 *     The debugee part of the test rai7~ses uncaught ArithmeticException by
 *     deviding integer by zero
 * COMMENTS
 *     See also bug 4323439
 *     --------------------------------
 *     Test fixed due to bug:
 *     4455653 VMDisconnectedException on resume
 *     --------------------------------
 *     To fix 4615225,
 *     the test suite was moved here.
 *     --------------------------------
 *     Test updated to prevent possible VMDisconnectedException on VMDeathEvent:
 *     - quit on VMDeathEvent is added to event handling loop
 *     - standard method Debugee.endDebugee() is used instead of cleaning event queue
