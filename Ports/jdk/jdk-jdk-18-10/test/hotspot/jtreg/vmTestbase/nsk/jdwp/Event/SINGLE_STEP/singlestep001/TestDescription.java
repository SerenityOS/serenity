 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdwp/Event/SINGLE_STEP/singlestep001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdwp]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *     This test performs checking for
 *         command set: Event
 *         command: Composite
 *         command set: EventRequest
 *         command: Set, Clear
 *         event kind: SINGLE_STEP
 *     Test checks that
 *         1) debuggee successfully creates SINGLE_STEP event request
 *            for particular threadID with attributes:
 *            depth=OVER, size=LINE
 *         2) expected SINGLE_STEP event is received when the thread
 *            in debuggee steps to the next line after breakpoint
 *         3) debuggee successfully removes event request
 *     Test consists of two compoments:
 *         debugger: singlestep001
 *         debuggee: singlestep001a
 *     First, debugger uses nsk.share support classes to launch debuggee,
 *     and obtains Transport object, that represents JDWP transport channel.
 *     Next, debugger waits for tested class loaded and gets methodID
 *     and location for expected single step event after breakpoint.
 *     Then debugger waits for breakpoint reached with some thread
 *     and makes request for SINGLE_STEP event for this threadID.
 *     When event is received debugger checks if the received event is for
 *     expected request, thread, and location and has correct attributes.
 *     Then debugger removes event request.
 *     Finally, debugger disconnects debuggee, waits for it exited
 *     and exits too with proper exit code.
 * COMMENTS
 *     Test was fixed due to test bug:
 *     4797978 TEST_BUG: potential race condition in a number of JDWP tests
