 * VM Testbase keywords: [jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     The test checks up the method com.sun.jdi.ClassType.newInstance()
 *     Test checks up the following assertion:
 *          Primitive arguments must be either assignment compatible with
 *          the argument type or must be convertible to the argument type
 *          without loss of information.
 *     for every primitive type.
 * COMMENTS:
 *     Test was fixed according to test bug:
 *     4778296 TEST_BUG: debuggee VM intemittently hangs after resuming
 *     - handling VMStartEvent was removed from the debugger part of the test
 *     Test fixed according to test bug:
 *     4798088 TEST_BUG: setBreakpoint() method depends of the locations implementation
 *     - using standard Debugee.setBreakpoint() method
 *     - adjusting source line numbers used for setting breakpoint
