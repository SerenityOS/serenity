 * @test
 *
 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/Location/sourceName/sourcename001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     The test for the implementation of an object of the type
 *     Location.
 *     The test checks up that a result of the method
 *     com.sun.jdi.Location.sourceName()
 *     complies with its spec:
 *     public String sourceName()
 *                   throws AbsentInformationException
 *     Gets an identifing name for the source corresponding to this location.
 *     Interpretation of this string is the responsibility of
 *     the source repository mechanism.
 *     In the reference implementation, the returned string is
 *     the unqualified name of the source file for this Location.
 *     Returns: a string specifying the source
 *     Throws: AbsentInformationException -
 *             if the source name is not known
 *     The test works as follows:
 *     The debugger program - nsk.jdi.Location.sourceName.sourcename001;
 *     the debuggee program - nsk.jdi.Location.sourceName.sourcename001a.
 *     Using nsk.jdi.share classes,
 *     the debugger gets the debuggee running on another JavaVM,
 *     creates the object debuggee.VM,
 *     establishes a pipe with the debuggee program, and then
 *     send to the programm commands, to which the debuggee replies
 *     via the pipe. Upon getting reply,
 *     the debugger calls corresponding debuggee.VM methods to get
 *     needed data and compares the data got to the data expected.
 *     In case of error the test produces the return value 97 and
 *     a corresponding error message(s).
 *     Otherwise, the test is passed and produces
 *     the return value 95 and no message.
 * COMMENTS:
 *     This test is option depended,
 *     that is its .cfg file contains the option
 *         JAVAC_OPTS=-g
 *     because at the date of preparing the test
 *     javac prepared full information for the test only
 *     been invoked with the option.
