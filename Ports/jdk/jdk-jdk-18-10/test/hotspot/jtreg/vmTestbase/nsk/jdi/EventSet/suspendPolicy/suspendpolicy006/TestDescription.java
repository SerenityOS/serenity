 * @test
 *
 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/EventSet/suspendPolicy/suspendpolicy006.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     The test for the implementation of an object of the type
 *     EventSet.
 *     The test checks up that a result of the method
 *     com.sun.jdi.EventSet.suspendPolicy()
 *     complies with its spec:
 *     public int suspendPolicy()
 *      Returns the policy used to suspend threads in the target VM for this event set.
 *      This policy is selected from the suspend policies for each event's request;
 *      the target VM chooses the policy which suspends the most threads.
 *      The target VM suspends threads according to that policy and
 *      that policy is returned here.
 *      See EventRequest for the possible policy values.
 *      In rare cases, the suspend policy may differ from the requested value if
 *      a ClassPrepareEvent has occurred in a debugger system thread.
 *      See ClassPrepareEvent.thread() for details.
 *      Returns: the suspendPolicy which is either SUSPEND_ALL,
 *               SUSPEND_EVENT_THREAD or SUSPEND_NONE.
 *     The test checks that for a MethodEntryEvent set,
 *     the method returns values corresponding to one which suspends the most threads.
 *     The cases to check include event sets containing one to three threads
 *     with all possible combinations:
 *     NONE, THREAD, ALL, NONE+THREAD, NONE+ALL, THREAD+ALL, NONE+THREAD+ALL
 *     The test works as follows:
 *     The debugger program - nsk.jdi.EventSet.suspendPolicy.suspendpolicy006;
 *     the debuggee program - nsk.jdi.EventSet.suspendPolicy.suspendpolicy006a.
 *     Using nsk.jdi.share classes,
 *     the debugger gets the debuggee running on another JavaVM,
 *     creates the object debuggee.VM, and waits for VMStartEvent.
 *     Upon getting the debuggee VM started,
 *     the debugger calls corresponding debuggee.VM methods to get
 *     needed data and to perform checks.
 *     In case of error the test produces the return value 97 and
 *     a corresponding error message(s).
 *     Otherwise, the test is passed and produces
 *     the return value 95 and no message.
