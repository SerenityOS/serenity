 *
 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/EventRequestManager/deleteEventRequest/delevtreq003.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdi, redefine]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     The test checks up com.sun.jdi.EventRequestManager.deleteEventRequest()
 *     after class file redefinition.
 *     The test performs as follow:
 *     Debuggee has two classes (A and B). Debugger creates a BreakpointRequest
 *     at the first class A and waits a corresponding event. After getting
 *     BreakpointEvent, debugger redefines the second class B and tries to
 *     delete BreakpointRequest.
 * COMMENTS
 *     Test was fixed according to test bug:
 *     4778296 TEST_BUG: debuggee VM intemittently hangs after resuming
 *     - handling VMStartEvent was removed from the debugger part of the test
 *     - quit on VMDeathEvent was added to the event handling loop
 *     Test updated to wait for debugee VM exit:
 *     - standard method Debugee.endDebugee() is used instead of final Debugee.resume()
