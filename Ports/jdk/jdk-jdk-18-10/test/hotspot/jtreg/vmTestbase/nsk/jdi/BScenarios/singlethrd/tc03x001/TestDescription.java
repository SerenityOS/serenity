 * @test
 *
 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/BScenarios/singlethrd/tc03x001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     This test is from the group of so-called Borland's scenarios and
 *     implements the following test case:
 *         Suite 2 - Breakpoints (multiple threads)
 *         Test case:      TC2
 *         Description:    Class breakpoint
 *         Steps:          1.Add class breakpoint: singlethread.Class1
 *                         2.Debug Main
 *                           X. Stops on line 13 in Class1.java
 *     The description was drown up according to steps under JBuilder.
 *     Of course, the test has own line numbers and method/class names and
 *     works as follow:
 *     When the test is starting debugee, debugger creates MethodEntryRequest.
 *     After MethodEntryEvent arrived, debugger checks line number of one's
 *     location. It should be 73th line, that is constructor of tc02x001aClass1
 *     class. Every thread must generate MethodEntryEvent.
 *     In case, when at least one event doesn't arrive during waittime
 *     interval or line number of event is wrong, test fails.
 * COMMENTS:
 *     There are a doublness of the "class breakpoint" understanding.
 *     Here is that JBuilder help says:
 *     1. "A class breakpoint causes the debugger to stop when any method
 *         from the specified class is called or when the specified class
 *         is instantiated."
 *         So, a class breakpoint is MethodEntryRequest with filtering
 *         the specified class.
 *     2. "A class breakpoint causes the debugger to stop at the location
 *         when the specified class is loaded or when any method from the
 *         specified class is called."
 *         In this case, a class breakpoint is MethodEntryRequest and
 *         ClassPrepareRequest with filtering the specified class.
 *     Test was fixed according to test bug:
 *     4778296 TEST_BUG: debuggee VM intemittently hangs after resuming
 *     - handling VMStartEvent was removed from the debugger part of the test
 *     - quit on VMDeathEvent was added to the event handling loop
