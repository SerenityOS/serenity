 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/FloatValue/compareTo/compareto001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *   The test for the compareTo(Object o) method of com.sun.jdi.FloatValue
 *   interface. This method is inherited from java.lang.Comparable interface.
 *   The test checks the following assertions which imply from spec for
 *   Comparable.compareTo(Object o):
 *    - (x.compareTo(y) == 0) is identical to (x.equals(y) == true);
 *    - (x.compareTo(y) == 0) is identical to (y.compareTo(x) == 0);
 *    - if (x.compareTo(y) == i) then (y.compareTo(x) == -i);
 *    - if (x.compareTo(y) > 0) and (y.compareTo(z) > 0), then (x.compareTo(z) > 0);
 *    - if an argument is null, then NullPointerException is thrown;
 *    - if an argument is not of FloatValue type, then a ClassCastException is thrown.
 *   where 'x', 'y' and 'z' denote FloatValue object.
 *   The debugger program - nsk.jdi.FloatValue.compareto.compareto001;
 *   the debuggee program - nsk.jdi.FloatValue.compareto.compareto001a;
 *   The test works as follows:
 *   Using nsk.jdi.share classes, the debugger connects to the debuggee.
 *   Then the debugger gets a list of float fields of debuggee's object of
 *   compareto001aClassToCheck type. For every field a mirror of FloatValue type
 *   is created and the assertions are checked. A various values for comparison
 *   are got from values of mirrors of debuggee's static fields.
 *   In case of error the test produces the return value 97 and a corresponding
 *   error message(s). Otherwise, the test is passed and produces the return
 *   value 95 and no message.
