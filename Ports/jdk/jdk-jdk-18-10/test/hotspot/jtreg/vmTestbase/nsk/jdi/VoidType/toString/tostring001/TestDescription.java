 * @test
 *
 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/VoidType/toString/tostring001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *  The test for public toString() method of an implementing class of
 *  com.sun.jdi.VoidType interface.
 *  The test checks an assertion:
 *     In conformity with the contract for java.lang.Object.toString(),
 *     the overrided method returns representing non-empty string for
 *     a VoidType object of a debuggee's void type method.
 * COMMENTS:
 *  The test is aimed to increase jdi source code coverage and checks
 *  the code which was not yet covered by previous tests for VoidType
 *  interface. The coverage analysis was done for jdk1.4.0-b92 build.
 *     Test was fixed according to test bug:
 *     4778296 TEST_BUG: debuggee VM intemittently hangs after resuming
 *     - handling VMStartEvent was removed from the debugger part of the test
 *     Test fixed according to test bug:
 *     4798088 TEST_BUG: setBreakpoint() method depends of the locations implementation
 *     - using standard Debugee.setBreakpoint() method
 *     - adjusting source line numbers used for setting breakpoint
