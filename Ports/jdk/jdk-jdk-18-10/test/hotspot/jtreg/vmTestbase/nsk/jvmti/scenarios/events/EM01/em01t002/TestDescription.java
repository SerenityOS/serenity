 * DESCRIPTION
 *     This JVMTI test is for EM01 scenario of "events and event management" area.
 *     The test checks phase when events of required functionality VM_START,
 *     VM_INIT, VM_DEATH, CLASS_LOAD, CLASS_PREPARE, THREAD_START, THREAD_END
 *     are sent.
 *     The test starts threads and loads classes through JNI calls.
 *     Checked statements:
 *         - above-mentioned events are sent without holding any capability;
 *         - VM_INIT, VM_DEATH, CLASS_LOAD, CLASS_PREPARE events are sent
 *           during LIVE phase only;
 *         - THREAD_START, THREAD_END, VM_START are sent during START or
 *           LIVE phases;
 * COMMENTS
 *     Fixed bug
 *     5018642 JVMTI ClassPrepare and ClassLoad events now allowed during
 *              start phase
 *     Fixed
