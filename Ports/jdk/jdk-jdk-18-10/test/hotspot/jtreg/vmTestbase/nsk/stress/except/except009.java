 * DESCRIPTION
 *     This checks if various exceptions are thrown (and caught) correctly
 *     when there apparently are no free space in the heap to allocate new
 *     Throwable instance.
 *     The test tries to occupy all of memory available in the heap by allocating
 *     lots of new Object() instances. Instances of the type Object are the smallest
 *     objects, so they apparently should occupy most fine-grained fragments in the
 *     heap and leave no free space for new Throwable instance. After that, the test
 *     provokes various exceptions (e.g.: by executing integer division by 0 and so
 *     on), and checks if appropriate exceptions are thrown.
 * COMMENTS
 *     The test needs a lot of memory to start up, so it should not run under older
 *     JDK 1.1.x release due to its poorer heap utilization. Also, some checks are
 *     skipped when testing classic VM, because OutOfMemoryError is correctly thrown
 *     instead of target exception.
 *     When the test is being self-initiating (i.e.: eating heap), memory occupation
 *     is terminated if memory allocation slows down crucially. This is a workaround
 *     intended to avoid the HotSpot bug:
 *         #4248801 (P1/S5) slow memory allocation when heap is almost exhausted
 *     There is also a workaround involved to avoid the following bugs known
 *     for HotSpot and for classic VM:
 *         #4239841 (P1/S5) 1.1: poor garbage collector performance  (HotSpot bug)
 *         #4245060 (P4/S5) poor garbage collector performance       (Classic VM bug)
 *     However, printing of the test's error messages, warnings, and of execution
 *     trace fails under JDK 1.2 for Win32 even so. If the test fails due to this
 *     problem, exit status 96 is returned instead of 97.
 *     JDK 1.3 classic VM for Sparc may crash (core dump) due to the known bug:
 *         #4245057 (P2/S3) VM crashes when heap is exhausted
 *

 * <p>
 * <p>The test tries to occupy all of memory available in the heap by
 * allocating lots of new <code>Object()</code> instances. Instances of the
 * type <code>Object</code> are the smallest objects, so they apparently should
 * occupy most fine-grained fragments in the heap and leave no free space for
 * new <code>Throwable</code> instance. After that, the test provokes various
 * exceptions (e.g.: by executing integer division by 0 and so on), and checks
 * if appropriate exceptions are thrown.
 * <p>
 * <p>Note, that memory occupation is terminated if memory allocation slows
 * down crucially. This is a workaround intended to avoid the HotSpot bug:
