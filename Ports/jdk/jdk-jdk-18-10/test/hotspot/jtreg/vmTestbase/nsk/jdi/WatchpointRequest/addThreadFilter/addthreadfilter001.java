/**
 * The test for the implementation of an object of the type
 * WatchpointRequest.
 *
 * The test checks that results of the method
 * <code>com.sun.jdi.WatchpointRequest.addThreadFilter()</code>
 * complies with its spec.
 *
 * The test checks up on the following assertion:
 *    Restricts the events generated by this request
 *    to those in the given thread.
 *
 * The test works as follows.
 * - The debugger resumes the debuggee and waits for the BreakpointEvent.
 * - The debuggee creates two threads, thread1 and thread2, and invokes
 *   the methodForCommunication to be suspended and
 *   to inform the debugger with the event.
 * - Upon getting the BreakpointEvent, the debugger
 *   - sets up a WatchpointRequest within the method
 *     in the class TestClass which will be calling by both threads,
 *   - restricts the watchpoint event only for thread1,
 *   - resumes debuggee's main thread, and
 *   - waits for the event.
 * - Debuggee's main thread starts both threads.
 * - Upon getting the event, the debugger performs the checks required.
