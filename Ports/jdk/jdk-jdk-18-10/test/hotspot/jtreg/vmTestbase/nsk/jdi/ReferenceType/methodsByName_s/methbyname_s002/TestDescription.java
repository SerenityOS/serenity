 * @test
 *
 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/ReferenceType/methodsByName_s/methbyname_s002.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *         nsk/jdi/ReferenceType/methodsByName_s/methbyname_s002 test
 *         checks the methodsByName(String name) method of ReferenceType interface
 *         of the com.sun.jdi package for not prepared class:
 *        the checked class is loaded but is not prepared.
 *        The ReferenceType.methodsByName(String name) method is called for
 *        this class - ClassNotPreparedException should be thrown
 *        in this case.
 * COMMENTS
 * The test is updated as follows:
 * - statements for establishing ArgumentHandler, LogHandler and Binder are updated
 *   to comply with new version of the shared classes;
 * - a number of statements "out_stream.println" are replaced with
 * "print_log_on_verbose" and "print_log_anyway".
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 *  4477989 TEST_BUG: some nine ReferenceType tests use wrong assumption
