 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdwp/Event/VM_DEATH/vmdeath001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdwp]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *     This test performs checking for
 *         command set: Event
 *         command: Composite
 *         event kind: VM_DEATH
 *     Test checks that debugee accept the event packet with correct
 *     attributes at debuggee's exit.
 *     Test consists of two compoments:
 *         debugger: vmdeath001
 *         debuggee: vmdeath001a
 *     First, debugger uses nsk.share support classes to launch debuggee
 *     and obtain Transport object, that represents JDWP transport channel.
 *     Debugger waits for debuggee started and resumes it to allow debuggee
 *     to exit.
 *     Next, debugger waits for an event packet and check if the received
 *     event is a single VM_DEATH event with correct attributes.
 *     Finally, debugger disconnects debuggee, waits for it exited
 *     and exits too with proper exit code.
 * COMMENTS
 *     Test was fixed due to test bug:
 *     4797978 TEST_BUG: potential race condition in a number of JDWP tests
