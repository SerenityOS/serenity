 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/Argument/isValid/isvalid003.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     The test for the implementation of an object of the type
 *     Connector.Argument.
 *     The test checks up that a result of the method
 *     com.sun.jdi.connect.Connector.Argument.isValid()
 *     complies with its specification, that is,
 *     "Returns: true if the value is valid to be used in setValue(String)"
 *     in case when Argument implements StringArgument
 *     and its parameter is a null-string .
 *     The test works as follows:
 *     - Virtual Machine Manager is invoked.
 *     - First Connector.StringArgument object is searched among
 *     Arguments of Connectors.
 *     If no the object is found out the test exits
 *     with the return value = 95 and a warning message.
 *     - To a Connector.Argument (!!!) argument
 *     the following check is applied:
 *     String sNull = null;
 *     IF    !argument.isValid(sNull)
 *     THEN  an error detected
 *     ELSE  the check passed
 *     In case of error the test produces the return value 97 and
 *     a corresponding error message(s).
 *     Otherwise, the test is passed and produces
 *     the return value 95 and no message.
