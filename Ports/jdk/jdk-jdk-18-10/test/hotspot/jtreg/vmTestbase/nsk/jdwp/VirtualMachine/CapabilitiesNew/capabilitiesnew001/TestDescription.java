 * DESCRIPTION
 *     This test performs checking for
 *         command set: VirtualMachine
 *         command: CapabilitiesNew
 *     Test checks that debugee accept command and replies
 *     with correct reply packet.
 *     First, test launches debuggee VM using support classes
 *     and connects to it.
 *     Then test sends CapabilitiesNew command and waits for a
 *     reply packet.
 *     Then test checks if the received reply packet has proper
 *     structure and extracts capabilities info from the packet data.
 *     After JDWP command has been tested, test sends debugee VM
 *     signal to quit, waits for debugee VM exits and exits too
 *     with the proper exit code.
 * COMMENTS
 *     This test is for JDK-1.4 or higher.
