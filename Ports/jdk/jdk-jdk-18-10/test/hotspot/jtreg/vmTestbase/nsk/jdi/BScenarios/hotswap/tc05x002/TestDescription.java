 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/BScenarios/hotswap/tc05x002.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdi, redefine]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     This test is from the group of so-called Borland's scenarios and
 *     implements the following test case:
 *         Suite 3 - Hot Swap
 *         Test case:      TC5
 *         Description:    After point of execution, same method - stepping
 *         Steps:          1.Set breakpoint at line 24 (call to b()
 *                            from a())
 *                         2.Debug Main
 *                         3.Insert as next line after point of
 *                            execution: System.err.println("foo");
 *                         4.Smart Swap
 *                         5.F7 to step into
 *                            X. Steps into method b()
 *     The description was drown up according to steps under JBuilder.
 *     Of course, the test has own line numbers and method/class names and
 *     works as follow:
 *     When the test is starting debugee, debugger sets breakpoint at
 *     the 38th line (method method_A).
 *     After the breakpoint is reached, debugger redefines debugee adding
 *     a new line into method_A, creates StepRequest and resumes debugee.
 *     When the location of the current StepEvent is in method_B, created
 *     StepRequest is disabled.
 * COMMENTS:
 *     The scenario mentions debugee crashes on 1.4.0-b91.
 *     The test differs from tc05x001 by that it works without IOPipe
 *     channel and instead of the crash unexpected IllegalArgumentException
 *     is thrown.
 *     After redefining location of the first step event is expected at the
 *     redefined method according to #4756474.
 *     Test was fixed according to test bug:
 *     4778296 TEST_BUG: debuggee VM intemittently hangs after resuming
 *     - handling VMStartEvent was removed from the debugger part of the test
 *     - quit on VMDeathEvent was added to the event handling loop
 *     Test updated to wait for debugee VM exit:
 *     - standard method Debugee.endDebugee() is used instead of final Debugee.resume()
