 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdwp/ThreadGroupReference/Children/children001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdwp]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *     This test performs checking for
 *         command set: ThreadGroupReference
 *         command: Children
 *     Test checks that debugee accepts command and replies
 *     with correct reply packet.
 *     First, test launches debuggee VM using support classes
 *     and connects to it.
 *     Then test queries debugee VM for ThreadGroupReferenceIDs
 *     of all top level thread groups.
 *     Then test sends Children command for each ThreadGroupReferenceID
 *     and waits for a reply packet.
 *     Test checks if the each received reply packet has proper
 *     structure and extract childs info of the queried thread group.
 *     After JDWP command has been tested, test sends debugee VM
 *     signal to quit, waits for debugee exits and exits too
 *     with a proper exit code.
