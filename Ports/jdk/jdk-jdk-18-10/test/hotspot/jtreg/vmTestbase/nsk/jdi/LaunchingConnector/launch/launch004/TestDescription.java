 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/LaunchingConnector/launch/launch004.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *     This test is debugger-like application. It starts
 *     debugee VM so that debugger/debugee connection be correctly
 *     established via connector com.sun.jdi.RawCommandLineLaunch
 *     and dt_shmem transport.
 *     Note that unlike most of JDI tests, this test
 *     will always fail if launching of other JVM is prohibited
 *     by security restrictions.
 * COMMENTS
 *     Test updated to support launching debuggee VM from another JDK
 *     Test was fixed according to test bug:
 *     4778296 TEST_BUG: debuggee VM intemittently hangs after resuming
 *     - debuggee wrapper is used to handle VMStartEvent
 *     - output redirectors are incapsulated in the wrapper
 *
