 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/ClassType/invokeMethod/invokemethod011.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *     This test checks that invocation with all threads resumption
 *     and the single threaded one will be performed properly through
 *     the JDI method:
 *         com.sun.jdi.ClassType.invokeMethod().
 *     The following assertions are verified:
 *         - by default, all threads in the target VM are resumed while
 *           the method is being invoked;
 *         - when the invocation completes, all threads in the target VM
 *           are suspended, regardless their state before the invocation;
 *         - only the specified thread will be resumed with the flag
 *           INVOKE_SINGLE_THREADED;
 *         - upon completion of a single threaded invoke, the invoking
 *           thread will be suspended once again.
 *     A debuggee part of the test starts several threads. Then debugger
 *     calls the JDI method without and with the flag INVOKE_SINGLE_THREADED
 *     sequentially. During the invocations and after them the threads state
 *     is expected to be as described above.
 * COMMENTS
 *     Fixed TEST_BUG 6358778.
