 * @test
 *
 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/ObjectReference/disableCollection/disablecollection001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     The test for the implementation of an object of the type
 *     ObjectReference.
 *     The test checks up that a result of the method
 *     com.sun.jdi.ObjectReference.disableCollection()
 *     complies with its spec:
 *     public void disableCollection()
 *     Prevents garbage collection for this object.
 *     By default all ObjectReference values returned by JDI may be
 *     collected at any time the target VM is running.
 *     A call to this method guarantees that the object will not be collected.
 *     enableCollection() can be used to allow collection once again.
 *     Calls to this method are counted.
 *     Every call to this method requires a corresponding call to
 *     enableCollection() before garbage collection is re-enabled.
 *     Note that while the target VM is suspended,
 *     no garbage collection will occur because all threads are suspended.
 *     The typical examination of variables, fields, and arrays during
 *     the suspension is safe without explicitly disabling garbage collection.
 *     This method should be used sparingly, as
 *     it alters the pattern of garbage collection in the target VM and,
 *     consequently, may result in application behavior under the debugger that
 *     differs from its non-debugged behavior.
 *     Throws: ObjectCollectedException -
 *             if this object has been garbage collected.
 *     The test works as follows:
 *     The debugger program - nsk.jdi.ObjectReference.disableCollection.disablecollection001;
 *     the debuggee program - nsk.jdi.ObjectReference.disableCollection.disablecollection001a.
 *     Using nsk.jdi.share classes,
 *     the debugger gets the debuggee running on another JavaVM,
 *     creates the object debuggee.VM,
 *     establishes a pipe with the debuggee program, and then
 *     send to the programm commands, to which the debuggee replies
 *     via the pipe. Upon getting reply,
 *     the debugger calls corresponding debuggee.VM methods to get
 *     needed data and compares the data got to the data expected.
 *     In case of error the test produces the return value 97 and
 *     a corresponding error message(s).
 *     Otherwise, the test is passed and produces
 *     the return value 95 and no message.
