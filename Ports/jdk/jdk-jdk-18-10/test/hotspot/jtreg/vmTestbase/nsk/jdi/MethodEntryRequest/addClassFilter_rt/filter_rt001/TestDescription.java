 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/MethodEntryRequest/addClassFilter_rt/filter_rt001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     The test for the implementation of an object of the type
 *     MethodEntryRequest.
 *     The test checks up that a result of the method
 *     com.sun.jdi.MethodEntryRequest.addClassFilter(ReferenceType)
 *     complies with its spec:
 *     public void addClassFilter(ReferenceType refType)
 *      Restricts the events generated by this request to those
 *      whose location is in the given reference type or any of its subtypes.
 *      An event will be generated for any location in a reference type
 *      that can be safely cast to the given reference type.
 *      Parameters: refType - the reference type to filter on.
 *      Throws: InvalidRequestStateException -
 *              if this request is currently enabled or has been deleted.
 *              Filters may be added only to disabled requests.
 *     The test checks up on the following assertion:
 *         Restricts the events generated by this request to those
 *         whose location is in the given reference type or any of its subtypes.
 *     The test works as follows:
 *     The debugger program - nsk.jdi.MethodEntryRequest.addClassFilter_rt.filter_rt001;
 *     the debuggee program - nsk.jdi.MethodEntryRequest.addClassFilter_rt.filter_rt001a.
 *     Using nsk.jdi.share classes,
 *     the debugger gets the debuggee running on another JavaVM,
 *     creates the object debuggee.VM, and waits for VMStartEvent.
 *     Upon getting the debuggee VM started,
 *     the debugger calls corresponding debuggee.VM methods to get
 *     needed data and to perform checks.
 *     In case of error the test produces the return value 97 and
 *     a corresponding error message(s).
 *     Otherwise, the test is passed and produces
 *     the return value 95 and no message.
 * COMMENTS:
 *     4930911 TEST_BUG: filter_rt006 debuggee has a race
