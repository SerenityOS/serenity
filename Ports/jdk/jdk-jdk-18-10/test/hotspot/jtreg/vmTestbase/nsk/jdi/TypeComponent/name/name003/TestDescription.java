 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/TypeComponent/name/name003.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *     This test checks the name() method of TypeComponent interface of
 *     com.sun.jdi package.
 *     The method spec:
 *     public java.lang.String name()
 *     Gets the name of this type component.
 *     Note: for fields, this is the field name; for methods, this is the
 *           method name; for constructors, this is <init>; for static
 *           initializers, this is <clinit>.
 *     Returns: a string containing the name.
 *     nsk/jdi/TypeComponent/name/name003 checks assertions:
 *     public java.lang.String name()
 *     1. Returns "<init>" for a constructor;
 *     2. Returns "<clinit>" for a static initializer.
 *     Debugger gets all methods from debuggee, finds only constructors and
 *     static initializers and then checks if name() returns "<init>" for
 *     constructors and "<clinit>" for static initializers.
