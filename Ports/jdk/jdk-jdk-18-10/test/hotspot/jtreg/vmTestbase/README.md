# VM Testbase landing

This directory serves as a _temporary_ landing place for tests converted from so-called VM testbase.
Most of these tests have been written a long time ago, don't meet modern coding
standards, guidelines and are in need of reworking.
Eventually, all the tests located here should be reworked and moved accordingly to
regular JTReg test suite directory layout convention, i.e. following the same
layout as product code as close as possible.

New tests must **not** be added into this directory.
