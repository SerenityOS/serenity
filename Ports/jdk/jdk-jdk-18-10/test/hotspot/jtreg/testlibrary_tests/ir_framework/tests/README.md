# Framework internal tests
This folder contains tests which test the functionality of the framework. These are run with JTreg and are part of tier testing. All tests are run without additional VM and Javaopts flags. These tests must pass whenever the framework is updated.

Additional testing should be performed with the converted Valhalla tests to make sure a changeset is correct (these are part of the Valhalla CI).
