Briefly, the tests cover the following scenarios:
1. prepre
   set signal handlers -> create JVM -> send signals -> destroy JVM -> check signal handlers were called

2. prepost
   set signal handlers -> create JVM -> destroy JVM -> send signals  -> check signal handlers were called

3. postpre
   create JVM ->set signal handlers -> send signals -> destroy JVM -> check signal handlers were called

4. postpost
   create JVM -> set signal handlers -> destroy JVM -> send signals  -> check signal handlers were called

There is one more scenario called 'nojvm'.
In this case no jvm is created, so pure signal testing is done.

Signal handlers don't do anything, so the only fact that signal handler was called is checked.
Also 2 different ways of setting signal handlers are tested: sigaction, sigset.

For 'postpre' and 'postpro' libjsig.so is used to chain signal handlers behind VM installed ones.

=> Current tests cover the following cases (don't count 'nojvm' scenario):
1. Support for pre-installed signal handlers when the HotSpot VM is created.
2. Support for signal handler installation after the HotSpot VM is created inside JNI code


Notes:

SIGQUIT, SIGTERM, SIGINT, and SIGHUP signals cannot be chained.
If the application needs to handle these signals, the -Xrs option needs
to be specified. So, test these signals only with -Xrs flag.

On Linux and Mac OS X, SIGUSR2 is used to implement suspend and resume. So,
don't test SIGUSR2 on Linux and Mac OS X.
