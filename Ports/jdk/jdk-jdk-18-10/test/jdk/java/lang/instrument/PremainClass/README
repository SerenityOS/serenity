This directory contains a test to exercise the Premain-Class attribute with
a non US-ASCII class name. As the file system may not support a file with 
this name the test is compiled off-line and the jar file checked into SCCS.

In the event that Agent.jar needs to be re-built here are the steps which
must be performed on a system that supports the the EURO in a file name
(Windows 2000 is fine) :-

1. Create the agent source file and agent.mf :-

    javac CreateFiles.java
    java CreateFiles

2. Re-create the agent jar file :-

    rm CreateFiles.class
    javac -encoding utf8 *.java
    jar cfm Agent.jar agent.mf *.class

3. Check Agent.jar into SCCS.
