    <title>Disable Auto-adjust Daylight Saving Time Test</title>
  </head>

  <body>
This applet tests the platform time zone detection on all platforms (Part I)
and on/off of DST adjustment on Windows (Part II).

Part I:

Observe the displayed Time zone ID and the local time. If you can change
the platform time zone setting, try several time zones. If both the ID and
the local time, including the time zone name and its time zone offset, are
always correct, Part I passes. Note that some time zone IDs have their
aliases that may be displayed.  For example, "US/Pacific" is an alias of
"America/Los_Angeles".

If you are running this applet in non-English locale, the time zone names
can be displayed in the local language and English by pushing the
English/Local button.

If platform time zones are NOT detected correctly, press the Fail button
to finish this applet.

If this platform is Windows, proceed to Part II. Otherwise, press the Pass
button to finish this applet.

Part II:

Note that Part II may require the Administrator privilege to change
Windows setting.

  1. Open the Date and Time control panel.
  2. Select any time zone where daylight saving time is *currently* in effect,
     such as "(GMT-08:00) Pacific Time (US & Canada); Tijuana",
     "(GMT+10:00) Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney", and Apply.
  3. Observe the local time on the control panel (Date&Time pane) and
     the applet local time should be the same (daylight time).
  4. Clear "Automatically adjust clock for daylight saving changes" and Apply.
  5. Observe the two local times should be the same (standard time).
  6. Select "Automatically adjust clock for daylight saving changes" and Apply.

If the local time in the control panel and applet are always the same,
then this test passes. Press the Pass or Fail button based on the Part II
result and finish this applet.
