<applet code="MultiDisplayTest.class" width=100 height=30></applet>

This test is for OS X or Windows only.
For other OSes please simply push "Pass".

The test requires two-display configuration, where

- 1st display is operating in HiDPI mode;
- 2nd display is non-HiDPI.

In other cases please simply push "Pass".


To run test please push "Start".

Then drag parent / child to different displays and check
that the proper image is shown for every window
(must be "black 1x" for non-HiDPI and "blue 2x" for HiDPI).

Please try to drag both parent and child,
do it fast several times and check if no artefacts occur.

Try to switch display resolution (high to low and back).

For Mac OS X please check also the behavior for
translucent windows appearing on the 2nd (non-active) display
and Mission Control behavior.

Close the windows.

In case if no issues occur please push "Pass", otherwise "Fail".
