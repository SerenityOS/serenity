      <h1>Test for KEY_PRESS event for accented characters: Bug id 4490692</h1>

This test is for unix platforms only. Press OK if you are not
testing on those platforms.

Before the test, you need to modify the keyboard mapping for X by issueing
the following command:

xmodmap -e 'keycode 60 = aacute'  (this is for Solaris Sparc keyboard)
xmodmap -e 'keycode 23 = aacute'  (this is for Linux PC keyboard)

This command lets you type 'a with acute' character when you press 'Tab' keytop. <b>Please
do not fail to restore the original key mapping by doing the following after the test</b>

xmodmap -e 'keycode 60 = Tab'  (this is for Solaris Sparc keyboard)
xmodmap -e 'keycode 23 = Tab'  (this is for Linux PC keyboard)

Confirm the following two behaviors:

    "KEYPRESS received for aacute" is displayed when you press 'Tab' keytop.
    On Solaris Sparc keyboard, The key sequence ("Compose", "a", "'") generates a-acute character in en_US locale
