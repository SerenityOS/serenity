  <body>
This test prints two pages and sends them to the printer.
One page is in PORTRAIT orientation and the other is in LANDSCAPE
orientation.  On each page it draws an ellipse inscribed in the clip
boundary established by the PrinterJob.  The ellipse should fill the
page within the bounds established by the default margins and not
extend off any end or side of the page.  Also, the string "Portrait"
or "Landscape" should be oriented correctly.
