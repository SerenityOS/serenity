Everything in this directory is dedicated to building the EvilProvider
used with the SecKeyFacSunJCEPRF test (JDK-8218723).

The makefile does require a JDK image path to be provided through the
JAVA_BASE makefile variable.  As an example:

make JAVA_BASE=/usr/java/jdk-11.0.1 evilprov

Since the EvilProvider is a modular jar, JDK 9 or later should be used.

For OpenJDK, no signing is required.  If signing is required (for use
with Oracle JDK, for instance), you must obtain a JCE signing certificate
and place it in a keystore, then run the "signed" makefile target (it will
build the jar file if it does not already exist).
