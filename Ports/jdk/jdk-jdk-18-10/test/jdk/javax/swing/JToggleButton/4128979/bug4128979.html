This test requires Windows look and feel, just press Pass if you
run it not on Windows.

When the test starts you'll see toggle buttons in three rows
two of which are toolbars.

Make these buttons pressed, their background color must change
to halftones between the button background colors and the ToggleButton
highlight color (it is shown in the square below). 

If the background color does not change correctly for at least one button,
the test fails.
