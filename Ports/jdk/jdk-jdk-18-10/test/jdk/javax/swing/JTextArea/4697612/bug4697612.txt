Introduction

     Thank you for downloading this release of the Java(TM) 2 SDK,
     Standard Edition. The Java 2 SDK is a development environment for
     building applications, applets, and components that can be
     deployed on the Java platform.

     The Java 2 SDK software includes tools useful for developing and
     testing programs written in the Java programming language and
     running on the Java platform. These tools are designed to be used
     from the command line. Except for appletviewer, these tools do not
     provide a graphical user interface.


Release Notes

      See the Release Notes on the Java Software web site for additional 
      information pertaining to this release.

Java 2 SDK Documentation

     The on-line Java 2 SDK Documentation contains API specifications,
     feature descriptions, developer guides, tool reference pages, demos, 
     and links to related information. It is located at

     http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/

     which you can install locally on your machine. See the 
     Java 2 SDK download page: 
     
     http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html


Redistribution

      The term "vendors" used here refers to licensees, developers, 
      and independent software vendors (ISVs) who license and 
      distribute the Java 2 Runtime Environment with their programs. 
      Vendors must follow the terms of the Java 2 SDK, Standard 
      Edition, Binary Code License agreement. 
      Required vs. Optional Files

      The files that make up the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, are
      divided into two categories: required and optional. Optional 
      files may be excluded from redistributions of the Java 2 SDK 
      at the vendor's discretion. The following section contains a 
      list of the files and directories that may optionally be 
      omitted from redistributions of the Java 2 SDK. All files not 
      in these lists of optional files must be included in 
      redistributions of the Java 2 SDK. 

      Optional Files and Directories

      The following files may be optionally excluded from 
      redistributions:

      jre/lib/charsets.jar

      file named javaws-1_2-solaris-sparc-i.zip,
      javaws-1_2-solaris-i586-i.zip,
      javaws-1_2-linux-i586-i.zip, or
      javaws-1_2-windows-i586-i.exe, depending on the platform. 


      Unlimited Strength Java Cryptography Extension

      Due to import control restrictions for some countries, the 
      Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) policy files shipped with 
      the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition and the Java 2 Runtime 
      Environment allow strong but limited cryptography to be 
      used.  These files are located at

      <java-home>/lib/security/local_policy.jar
      <java-home>/lib/security/US_export_policy.jar

      where <java-home> is the jre directory of the Java 2 
      SDK or the top-level directory of the Java 2 Runtime 
      Environment.

      An unlimited strength version of these files indicating 
      no restrictions on cryptographic strengths is available 
      on the Java 2 SDK web site for those living in eligible 
      countries.  Those living in eligible countries may download 
      the unlimited strength version and replace the strong 
      cryptography jar files with the unlimited strength files.


      Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism

      An endorsed standard is a Java API defined through a standards
      process other than the Java Community Process(SM) (JCP(SM)).
      Because endorsed standards are defined outside the JCP, it is
      anticipated that such standards will be revised between 
      releases of the Java 2 Platform. In order to take advantage of 
      new revisions to endorsed standards, developers and software
      vendors may use the Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism to
      provide newer versions of an endorsed standard than those
      included in the Java 2 Platform as released by Sun Microsystems.

      For more information on the Endorsed Standards Override
      Mechanism, including the list of platform packages that it may 
      be used to override, see 

            http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/standards/ 

      Classes in the packages listed on that web page may be replaced
      only by classes implementing a more recent version of the API 
      as defined by the appropriate standards body. 

      In addition to the packages listed in the document at the above 
      URL, which are part of the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition 
      (J2SE(TM)) specification, redistributors of Sun's J2SE 
      Reference Implementation are allowed to override classes whose 
      sole purpose is to implement the functionality provided by 
      public APIs defined in these Endorsed Standards packages.  
      Redistributors may also override classes in the org.w3c.dom.* 
      packages, or other classes whose sole purpose is to implement 
      these APIs.
