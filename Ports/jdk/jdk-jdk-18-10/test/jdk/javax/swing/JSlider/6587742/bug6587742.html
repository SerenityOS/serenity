Select every theme and check that all sliders looks good.
Note that every slider has a tooltip text with information about
slider configuration.
There is a small difference in sliders with property "filled = null" (it's
default behaviour when property JSlider.isFilled is not setted)
for themes:
1. OceanTheme - sliders look like filled
2. DefaultMetalTheme - sliders look like NOT filled
