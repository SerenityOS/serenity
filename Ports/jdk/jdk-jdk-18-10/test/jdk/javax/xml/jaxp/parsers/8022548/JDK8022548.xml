	These pages are all about XSLT, an XML-based language for translating one set of XML into another set of XML, or into HTML.  Of course, there are all sorts of <my:link href="#links">other pages</my:link>	around that cover XSLT.  Jeni's XSLT Pages, though, are dedicated to helping people understand and make the most of using XSLT.

	My warmest thanks to all those people who post interesting problems on <my:link href="http://www.mulberytech.com/xsl/xsl-list/">XSL-List</my:link>, and 	especially to those of you that have encouraged me to set up this site through your kind emails.
