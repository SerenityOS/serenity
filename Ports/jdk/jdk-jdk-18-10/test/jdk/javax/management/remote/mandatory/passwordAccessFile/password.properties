# Password file for Remote JMX API authentication. This file defines
# the different roles and their passwords.

# The file format for the password file is syntactically the same as
# the Properties file format. The syntax is described in the Javadoc
# for java.util.Properties.load.

# A typical password file has multiple lines, where each line is blank,
# a comment (like this one), or a password entry.

# A password entry consists of a role name and an associated password.
# The role name is any string that does not itself contain spaces or
# tabs. The password is again any string that does not contain spaces
# or tabs. Note that passwords appear in the clear in this file, so it
# is a good idea not to use valuable passwords.

# A given role should have at most one entry in this file. If a role
# has no entry, it has no access.
# If multiple entries are found for the same role name, then the last
# one is used.

# In a typical installation, this file can be read by anybody on the
# local machine, and possibly by people on other machines.
# For security, you should either restrict the access to this file,
# or specify another, less accessible file in the management config
# file as described above.

# Role and password used for authentication by the RMI connector in
# this example.
