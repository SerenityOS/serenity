Use the test directory as you would for any other JDK regression test
suite.  All bugs integrated into this workspace should have a
corresponding test case checked in.  Ideally, every putback done should
also include a run of the regression suite to make sure nothing was
broken.


templates
=========
This directory stores any useful templates for JSSE regression tests.

JSSEClientServerTemplate
	This template is to allow the quick set up of generic
	client/server tests.  It forks off one thread to either be the
	client or the server side (user-controlled), then runs the
	tests in the main thread.

	Modify the doClientSide and doServerSide as appropriate.


etc
===
This directory stores keystore/truststores needed by the JSSE
regression suite.  By consolidating the main keystores here, any
expired certificates can be regenerated quickly.


Expansions
