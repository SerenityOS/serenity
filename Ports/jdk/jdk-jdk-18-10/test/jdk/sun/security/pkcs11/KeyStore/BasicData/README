The files in this directory are used by the Basic test.

The keys and certificates came from basic.keystore.
basic.keystore itself is not used in the Basic test,
but is needed to set up the files for the ClientAuth test.

basic.keystore is also saved here in case it is needed
(for example, to generate new certificates with extended validity dates).

The basic.keystore password is:  'password'

The solaris pkcs11_softtoken password is:  'pin'
