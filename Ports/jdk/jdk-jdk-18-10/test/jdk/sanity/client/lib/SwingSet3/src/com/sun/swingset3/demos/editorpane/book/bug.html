  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="4">This is a Creature so officious, that 'twill be known to 
      every one at one time or other, so busie, and so impudent, that it will 
      be intruding it self in every ones company, and so proud and aspiring withall, 
      that it fears not to trample on the best, and affects nothing so much as 
      a Crown; feeds and lives very high, and that makes it so saucy, as to pull 
      any one by the ears that comes in its way, and will never be quiet till 
      it has drawn blood: it is troubled at nothing so much as at a man that scratches 
      his head, as knowing that man is plotting and contriving some mischief against 
      it, and that makes it oftentime sculk into some meaner and lower place, and 
      run behind a mans back, though it go very much against the hair; which ill 
      conditions of it having made it better known then trusted, would exempt me 
      from making any further description of it, did not my faithful Mercury, my 
      Microscope, bring me other information of it. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">For this has discovered to me, by means of a very bright light 
      cast on it, that it is a Creature of a very odd shape ; it has a head shap'd 
      like that exprest in 35. Scheme marked with A, which seems almost Conical, 
      but is a little flatted on the upper and under sides, at the biggest part 
      of which, on either side behind the head (as it were, being the place where 
      other Creatures ears stand) are placed its two black shining goggle eyes 
      B B, looking backwards, and fenced round with several small cilia or hairs 
      that incompass it, so that it seems this Creature has no very good foresight: 
      It does not seem to have any eyelids, and therefore perhaps its eyes were 
      so placed, that it might the better cleanse them with its forelegs; and perhaps 
      this may be the reason, why they so much avoid and run from the light behind 
      them, for being made to live in the shady and dark recesses of the hair, 
      and thence probably their eye having a great aperture, the open and clear 
      light, especially that of the Sun, must needs very much offend them; to secure 
      these eyes from receiving any injury from the hairs through which it passes, 
      it has two horns that grow before it, in the place where one would have thought 
      the eyes should be; each of these C C have four joynts, which are fringed, 
      as 'twere, with small brisles, from which to the tip of its snout D, the 
      head seems very round and tapering, ending in a very sharp nose D, which 
      seems to have a small hole, and to be the passage through which he sucks 
      the blood. </font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><img src="Octavo/bug2.jpg" width="537" height="348"></p>
    <p><font size="4">Now whereas it if be plac'd on its back, with its belly 
      upwards, as it is in the 35. Scheme, it seems in several Positions to have 
      a resemblance of chaps, or jaws, as is represented in the Figure by E E, 
      yet in other postures those dark strokes disappear; and having kept several 
      of them in a box for two or three dayes, so that for all that time they had 
      nothing to feed on, I found, upon letting onecreep on my hand, that it immediately 
      fell to sucking, and did neither seem to thrust its nose very deep into the 
      skin, nor to open any kind of mouth, but I could plainly perceive a small 
      current of blood, which came directly from its snout, and past into its belly; 
      and about A there seem'd a contrivance, somewhat resembling a Pump, pair 
      of Bellows, or Heart, for by a very swift systole and diastole the blood 
      seem'd drawn from the nose, and forced into the body. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">It did not seem at all, though I viewed it a good while as 
      it was sucking, to thrust more of its nose into the skin then the very snout 
      D, nor did it cause the least discernable pain, and yet the blood seem'd 
      to run through its head very quick and freely, so that it seems there is 
      no part of the skin but the blood is dispers'd into, nay, even into the 
      cuticula; for had it thrust its whole nose in from D to C C, it would not 
      have amounted to the supposed thickness of that tegument, the length of 
      the nose being not more then a three hundredth part of an inch. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">It has six legs, covered with a very transparent shell, 
      and joynted exactly like a Crab's, or Lobster's; each leg is divided into 
      six parts by these joynts, and those have here and there several small hairs; 
      and at the end of each leg it has two claws, very properly adapted for its 
      peculiar use, being thereby inabled to walk very securely both on the skin 
      and hair; and indeed this contrivance of the feet is very curious, and could 
      not be made more commodiously and compendiously, for performing both these 
      requisite motions, of walking and climbing up the hair of a mans head, then 
      it is : for, by having the lesser claw (a) set so much short of the bigger 
      (b) when it walks on the skin the shorter touches not, and then the feet 
      are the same with those of a Mite, and several other small Insects, but by 
      means of the small joynts of the longer claw it can bend it round, and so 
      with both claws take hold of a hair, in the manner represented in the Figure, 
      the long transparent Cylinder F F F, being a Man's hair held by it. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">The Thorax seem'd cas'd with another kind of substance then 
      the belly, namely, with a thin transparent horny substance, which upon the fasting 
      of the Creature did not grow flaccid; through this I could plainly see the 
      blood, suck'd from my hand, to be variously distributed, and mov'd to and 
      fro; and about G there seem'd a pretty big white substance, which seem'd 
      to be moved within its thorax; besides, there appear'd very many small milk-white 
      vessels, which crost over the breast between the legs, out of which, on 
      either side, are many small branchings, these seem'd to be the veins and 
      arteries, for that which is analogus to blood in all Insects is milk-white. 
      </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">The belly is covered with a transparent substance likewise, 
      but more resembling a skin then a shell, for 'tis grain'd all over the belly 
      just like the skin in the palms of a man's hand, and when the belly is empty, 
      grows very flaccid and wrinkled ; at the upper end of this is placed the 
      stomach H H, and perhaps also the white spot I I may be the liver, or pancreas, 
      which by the peristaltick motion of the guts, is a little mov'd to and fro, 
      not with a systole and diastole, but rather with a thronging or justling 
      motion. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">Viewing one of these Creatures, after it had fasted two 
      dayes, all the hinder part was lank and flaccid, and the white spot I I 
      hardly mov'd, most of the white branchings disappear'd, and most also of 
      the redness or sucked blood in the guts, the peristaltick motion of which 
      was scarce discernable; but upon the suffering it to suck, it presently 
      fill'd the skin of the belly, and of the six scolop'd embosments on either side, 
      as full as it could be stuft ; the stomach and guts were as full as they 
      could hold; the peristaltick motion of the gut grew quick, and the justling 
      motion of I I accordingly ; multitudes of milk-white vessels seem'd quickly 
      filled, and turgid, which were perhaps the veins and arteries, and the Creature 
      was so greedy, that though it could not contain more, yet it continued sucking 
      as fast as ever, and as fast emptying it self behind : the digestion of this 
      Creature must needs be very quick, for though I perceiv'd the blood thicker 
      and blacker when suck'd, yet, when in the guts, it was of a very lovely 
      ruby colour, and that part of it, which was digested into the veins, seemed 
      white; whence it appears, that a further digestion of blood may make it 
      milk, at least of a resembling colour : What is else observable in the figure 
      of this Creature, maybe seen by the 35. Scheme.</font></p>
