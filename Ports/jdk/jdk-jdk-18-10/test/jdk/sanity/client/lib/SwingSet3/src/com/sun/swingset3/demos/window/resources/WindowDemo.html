            Show how Swing's top-level container,
            <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/JWindow.html">JWindow</a>, can be used to create areas on the screen which 
            <i>do not have system-supplied borders</i> and therefore cannot be moved or resized 
            by the user like frames or dialogs.  JWindow is commonly used to implement menus,
            tooltips, and popups.
