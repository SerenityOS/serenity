Provides the implementation classes for the <em>local:</em> protocol for
the HotSpot PerfData instrumentation buffer monitoring implementation.
</p>
<p>
The <em>local:</em> protocol is the default protocol for the PerfData
implementation. It utilizes a name shared memory mechanism, identified
by a backing store file in the file system name space. The location of
the backing store file is platform specific and is dictated primarily by
the JVM implementation. However, the <code>java.io.tmpdir</code> system
property generally contains the location of the files, with the exception
of the Solaris implementation, as the SDK and HotSpot JVM use different
locations for their temporary file storage. The HotSpot JVM uses the
<em>/tmp</em> directory and the SDK uses <em>/var/tmp</em>. The classes
in this specifically use <em>/tmp</em> when running on Solaris.
