.PP
A remote object registry is a bootstrap naming service that\[aq]s used
by RMI servers on the same host to bind remote objects to names.
Clients on local and remote hosts can then look up remote objects and
make remote method invocations.
.PP
The registry is typically used to locate the first remote object on
which an application needs to call methods.
That object then provides application\-specific support for finding
other objects.
.PP
The methods of the \f[CB]java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry\f[R] class are
used to get a registry operating on the local host or local host and
port.
.PP
The URL\-based methods of the \f[CB]java.rmi.Naming\f[R] class operate on
a registry and can be used to:
.IP \[bu] 2
Bind the specified name to a remote object
.IP \[bu] 2
Return an array of the names bound in the registry
.IP \[bu] 2
Return a reference, a stub, for the remote object associated with the
specified name
.IP \[bu] 2
Rebind the specified name to a new remote object
.IP \[bu] 2
Destroy the binding for the specified name that\[aq]s associated with a
remote object
