The source code provided with demos for the JDK is meant
to illustrate the usage of a given feature or technique and has been
deliberately simplified. Additional steps required for a
production-quality application, such as security checks, input
validation, and proper error handling, might not be present in the
sample code.

In some cases, the default security settings may block an execution
of demo applets in a browser. To adjust the security settings, please
refer to the following resource:

http://java.com/en/download/help/java_blocked.xml

Some demo applets need to be accessed through the HTTP or HTTPS
protocols to enable access to the required resources.
