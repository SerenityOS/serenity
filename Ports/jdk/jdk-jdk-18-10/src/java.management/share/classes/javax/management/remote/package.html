      <p>Interfaces for remote access to
	JMX MBean servers.
	This package defines the essential interfaces for making a JMX
	MBean server manageable remotely. The specification of this 
        functionality is completed by Part III of the 
       <a href="https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/mrel/jsr160/index2.html">
	JMX Specification, version 1.4</a></p>

      <p>The JMX specification defines the notion of <b>connectors</b>.
	A connector is attached to a JMX API MBean server and makes it
	accessible to remote Java clients. The client end of a
	connector exports essentially the same interface as the MBean
	server, specifically the {@link
	javax.management.MBeanServerConnection MBeanServerConnection}
	interface.</p>

      <p>A connector makes an MBean server remotely accessible through
	a given protocol. The JMX Remote API allows the use of different 
        type of connectors:

      <ul>
       <li>The JMX Remote API defines a standard connector,
	the <b>RMI Connector</b>, which provides remote access to an
        MBeanServer through RMI.

       <li>The JMX Remote API also defines an optional connector called 
        <b>JMXMP Connector</b> implementing the JMX Message Protocol 
	(JMXMP). As it is optional, it is not part of this bundle (see
	note below).

       <li>User-defined connector protocols are also possible using the 
	{@link javax.management.remote.JMXConnectorFactory
	JMXConnectorFactory} and, optionally, the Generic Connector
	(not part of this bundle, see note below).
      </ul>

      <p><u>Note</u>: the optional packages implementing
        the optional part of the <em>JMX Remote API</em>
        are not included in the <em>Java SE Platform</em> 
        but are available from the <em>JMX Remote API 
	<a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-java-plat-419418.html">
	Reference Implementation</a></em>.</p>


      <h2>Connector addresses</h2>

      <p>Typically, a connector server has an address, represented by the
	class {@link javax.management.remote.JMXServiceURL
	JMXServiceURL}.  An address for the RMI Connector can look
	like this:</p>

      <pre>
      service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://myhost:1099/myname
      </pre>

      <p>In this <code>JMXServiceURL</code>, the first <code>rmi:</code>
        specifies the RMI connector, while the second <code>rmi:</code> 
        specifies the RMI registry into which the RMI connector server 
        has stored its stub.

      <p>The example above shows only one form of address.
        An address for the RMI Connector can take several forms,
	as detailed in the documentation for the package
	<code>{@link javax.management.remote.rmi}</code>.</p>

      <h2>Creating a connector server</h2>

      <p>A connector server is created by constructing an instance of
	a subclass of {@link
	javax.management.remote.JMXConnectorServer
	JMXConnectorServer}.  Usually, this instance is created
        using the method {@link
        javax.management.remote.JMXConnectorServerFactory#newJMXConnectorServer(JMXServiceURL,
        java.util.Map, javax.management.MBeanServer)
	JMXConnectorServerFactory.newJMXConnectorServer}.</p>

      <p>Typically, a connector server is associated with an MBean
	server either by registering it in that MBean server, or by
	supplying the MBean server as a parameter when creating the
	connector server.</p>

      <h2>Creating a connector client</h2>

      <p>A connector client is usually created by supplying the
	<code>JMXServiceURL</code> of the connector server to connect to 
        to the {@link
	javax.management.remote.JMXConnectorFactory#connect(JMXServiceURL)
	JMXConnectorFactory.connect} method.</p>

      <p>For more specialized uses, a connector client can be created
	by directly instantiating a class that implements the {@link
	javax.management.remote.JMXConnector JMXConnector} interface,
	for example the class {@link
	javax.management.remote.rmi.RMIConnector
	RMIConnector}.</p>

      <h2>Additional client or server parameters</h2>

      <p>When creating a connector client or server, it is possible to
	supply an object of type {@link java.util.Map Map} that defines
	additional parameters.  Each entry in this Map has a key that is
	a string and an associated value whose type is appropriate for
	that key.  The standard keys defined by the JMX Remote API all
	begin with the string "<code>jmx.remote.</code>".  The document
	<em>JMX Remote API</em> lists these standard keys.</p>

      <h2>Connection identifiers</h2>

      <p>Every connection opened by a connector server has a string
	identifier, called its <b>connection id</b>.  This identifier
	appears in the {@link
	javax.management.remote.JMXConnectionNotification
	JMXConnectionNotification} events emitted by the connector
	server, in the list returned by {@link
	javax.management.remote.JMXConnectorServerMBean#getConnectionIds()
	getConnectionIds()}, and in the value
	returned by the client's {@link
	javax.management.remote.JMXConnector#getConnectionId()
	getConnectionId()} method.</p>

      <p>As an example, a connection ID can look something like this:</p>

      <pre>
rmi://192.18.1.9 username 1
      </pre>

      <p>The formal grammar for connection ids that follow this
         convention is as follows (using the grammar notation from section 2.4 of 
         <em>The Java Language Specification</em>):</p>
      <pre>
<em>ConnectionId:</em>
    <em>Protocol</em> : <em>ClientAddress<sub>opt</sub></em> Space <em>ClientId<sub>opt</sub></em> Space <em>ArbitraryText</em>

<em>ClientAddress:</em>
    // <em>HostAddress</em> <em>ClientPort<sub>opt</sub></em>

<em>ClientPort</em>
    : <em>HostPort</em>
      </pre>

      <p>The <code><em>Protocol</em></code> is a protocol that would
	be recognized by {@link
	javax.management.remote.JMXConnectorFactory
	JMXConnectorFactory}.</p>

      <p>The <code><em>ClientAddress</em></code> is the
	address and port of the connecting client, if these can be
	determined, otherwise nothing.  The
	<code><em>HostAddress</em></code> is the Internet address of
	the host that the client is connecting from, in numeric or DNS
	form.  Numeric IPv6 addresses are enclosed in square brackets
	<code>[]</code>.  The <code><em>HostPort</em></code> is the
	decimal port number that the client is connecting from.</p>

      <p>The <code><em>ClientId</em></code> is the identity of the
	client entity, typically a string returned by {@link
	javax.management.remote.JMXPrincipal#getName()
	JMXPrincipal.getName()}.  This string must not contain
	spaces.</p>

      <p>The <code><em>ArbitraryText</em></code> is any additional
	text that the connector server adds when creating the client id.
	At a minimum, it must be enough to distinguish this connection
	ID from the ID of any other connection currently opened by this
	connector server.</p>
