/**
 * A "splittable" pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) whose period
 * is roughly 2<sup>96</sup>.  Class {@link L32X64MixRandom} implements
 * interfaces {@link RandomGenerator} and {@link SplittableGenerator},
 * and therefore supports methods for producing pseudorandomly chosen
 * values of type {@code int}, {@code long}, {@code float}, {@code double},
 * and {@code boolean} (and for producing streams of pseudorandomly chosen
 * numbers of type {@code int}, {@code long}, and {@code double}),
 * as well as methods for creating new split-off {@link L32X64MixRandom}
 * objects or streams of such objects.
 *
 * <p>The {@link L32X64MixRandom} algorithm is a specific member of
 * the LXM family of algorithms for pseudorandom number generators;
 * for more information, see the documentation for package
 * {@link jdk.random}.  Each instance of {@link L32X64MixRandom}
 * has 96 bits of state plus one 32-bit instance-specific parameter.
 *
 * <p>If two instances of {@link L32X64MixRandom} are created with
 * the same seed within the same program execution, and the same
 * sequence of method calls is made for each, they will generate and
 * return identical sequences of values.
 *
 * <p>As with {@link java.util.SplittableRandom}, instances of
 * {@link L32X64MixRandom} are <em>not</em> thread-safe.  They are
 * designed to be split, not shared, across threads (see the {@link #split}
 * method). For example, a {@link java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinTask}
 * fork/join-style computation using random numbers might include a
 * construction of the form
 * {@code new Subtask(someL32X64MixRandom.split()).fork()}.
 *
 * <p>This class provides additional methods for generating random
 * streams, that employ the above techniques when used in
 * {@code stream.parallel()} mode.
 *
 * <p>Instances of {@link L32X64MixRandom} are not cryptographically
 * secure.  Consider instead using {@link java.security.SecureRandom}
 * in security-sensitive applications. Additionally,
 * default-constructed instances do not use a cryptographically random
 * seed unless the {@linkplain System#getProperty system property}
 * {@code java.util.secureRandomSeed} is set to {@code true}.

     * Implementation Overview.
     *
     * The split operation uses the current generator to choose four new 32-bit
     * int values that are then used to initialize the parameter `a` and the
     * state variables `s`, `x0`, and `x1` for a newly constructed generator.
     *
     * With high probability, no two generators so chosen will have the same
     * `a` parameter, and testing has indicated that the values generated by
     * two instances of {@link L32X64MixRandom} will be (approximately)
     * independent if the two instances have different values for `a`.
     *
     * The default (no-argument) constructor, in essence, uses
     * "defaultGen" to generate four new 32-bit values for the same
     * purpose.  Multiple generators created in this way will certainly
     * differ in their `a` parameters.  The defaultGen state must be accessed
     * in a thread-safe manner, so we use an AtomicLong to represent
     * this state.  To bootstrap the defaultGen, we start off using a
     * seed based on current time unless the
     * java.util.secureRandomSeed property is set. This serves as a
     * slimmed-down (and insecure) variant of SecureRandom that also
     * avoids stalls that may occur when using /dev/random.
     *
     * File organization: First static fields, then instance
     * fields, then constructors, then instance methods.
