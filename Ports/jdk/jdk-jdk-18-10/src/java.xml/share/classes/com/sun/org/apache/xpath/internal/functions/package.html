  <title>XPath functions Package.</title>
  <body>
    <p>Implements XPath functions -- each function is derived from Function, 
    FunctionOneArg, Function2Args, etc, with number-of-arguments checking being 
    applied mainly at compile time -- this package only implements XPath functions, 
    XSLT functions are found in the "templates" package.<p>
