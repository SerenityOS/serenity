When <simpleContent> is used, the base type must be a complexType whose content type is simple, or, only if restriction is specified, a complex type with mixed content and emptiable particle, or, only if extension is specified, a simple type. ''{1}'' satisfies none of these conditions.
        src-ct.2.2 = src-ct.2.2: Complex Type Definition Representation Error for type ''{0}''.  When a complexType with simpleContent restricts a complexType with mixed content and emptiable particle, then there must be a <simpleType> among the children of <restriction>.

It was detected that ''{2}'' is in namespace ''{1}'', but components from this namespace are not referenceable from schema document ''{0}''.
