 * SAX2 extension handler for lexical events.

 * <p>This is an optional extension handler for SAX2 to provide
 * lexical information about an XML document, such as comments
 * and CDATA section boundaries.
 * XML readers are not required to recognize this handler, and it
 * is not part of core-only SAX2 distributions.</p>
 *
 * <p>The events in the lexical handler apply to the entire document,
 * not just to the document element, and all lexical handler events
 * must appear between the content handler's startDocument and
 * endDocument events.</p>
 *
 * <p>To set the LexicalHandler for an XML reader, use the
 * {@link org.xml.sax.XMLReader#setProperty setProperty} method
 * with the property name
 * <code>http://xml.org/sax/properties/lexical-handler</code>
 * and an object implementing this interface (or null) as the value.
 * If the reader does not report lexical events, it will throw a
 * {@link org.xml.sax.SAXNotRecognizedException SAXNotRecognizedException}
 * when you attempt to register the handler.</p>
