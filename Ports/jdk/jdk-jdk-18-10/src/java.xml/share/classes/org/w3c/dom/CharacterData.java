/**
 * The <code>CharacterData</code> interface extends Node with a set of
 * attributes and methods for accessing character data in the DOM. For
 * clarity this set is defined here rather than on each object that uses
 * these attributes and methods. No DOM objects correspond directly to
 * <code>CharacterData</code>, though <code>Text</code> and others do
 * inherit the interface from it. All <code>offsets</code> in this interface
 * start from <code>0</code>.
 * <p>As explained in the <code>DOMString</code> interface, text strings in
 * the DOM are represented in UTF-16, i.e. as a sequence of 16-bit units. In
 * the following, the term 16-bit units is used whenever necessary to
 * indicate that indexing on CharacterData is done in 16-bit units.
 * <p>See also the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407'>Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Core Specification</a>.
