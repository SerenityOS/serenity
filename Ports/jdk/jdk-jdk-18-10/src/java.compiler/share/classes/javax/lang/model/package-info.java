/**
 * Types and hierarchies of packages comprising a {@index "Java language
 * model"}, a model of the declarations and types of the Java
 * programming language.
 *
 * The members of this package and its subpackages are for use in
 * language modeling and language processing tasks and APIs including,
 * but not limited to, the {@linkplain javax.annotation.processing
 * annotation processing} framework.
 *
 * <p> This language model follows a <i>mirror</i>-based design; see
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * Gilad Bracha and David Ungar. <i>Mirrors: Design Principles for
 * Meta-level Facilities of Object-Oriented Programming Languages</i>.
 * In Proc. of the ACM Conf. on Object-Oriented Programming, Systems,
 * Languages and Applications, October 2004.
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * In particular, the model makes a distinction between declared
 * language constructs, like the {@linkplain javax.lang.model.element
 * element} representing {@code java.util.Set}, and the family of
 * {@linkplain javax.lang.model.type types} that may be associated
 * with an element, like the raw type {@code java.util.Set}, {@code
 * java.util.Set<String>}, and {@code java.util.Set<T>}.
 *
 * <p>Unless otherwise specified, methods in this package will throw
 * a {@code NullPointerException} if given a {@code null} argument.
