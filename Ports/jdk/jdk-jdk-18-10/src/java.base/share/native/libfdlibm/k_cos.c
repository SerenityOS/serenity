/*
 * __kernel_cos( x,  y )
 * kernel cos function on [-pi/4, pi/4], pi/4 ~ 0.785398164
 * Input x is assumed to be bounded by ~pi/4 in magnitude.
 * Input y is the tail of x.
 *
 * Algorithm
 *      1. Since cos(-x) = cos(x), we need only to consider positive x.
 *      2. if x < 2^-27 (hx<0x3e400000 0), return 1 with inexact if x!=0.
 *      3. cos(x) is approximated by a polynomial of degree 14 on
 *         [0,pi/4]
 *                                       4            14
 *              cos(x) ~ 1 - x*x/2 + C1*x + ... + C6*x
 *         where the remez error is
 *
 *      |              2     4     6     8     10    12     14 |     -58
 *      |cos(x)-(1-.5*x +C1*x +C2*x +C3*x +C4*x +C5*x  +C6*x  )| <= 2
 *      |                                                      |
 *
 *                     4     6     8     10    12     14
 *      4. let r = C1*x +C2*x +C3*x +C4*x +C5*x  +C6*x  , then
 *             cos(x) = 1 - x*x/2 + r
 *         since cos(x+y) ~ cos(x) - sin(x)*y
 *                        ~ cos(x) - x*y,
 *         a correction term is necessary in cos(x) and hence
 *              cos(x+y) = 1 - (x*x/2 - (r - x*y))
 *         For better accuracy when x > 0.3, let qx = |x|/4 with
 *         the last 32 bits mask off, and if x > 0.78125, let qx = 0.28125.
 *         Then
 *              cos(x+y) = (1-qx) - ((x*x/2-qx) - (r-x*y)).
 *         Note that 1-qx and (x*x/2-qx) is EXACT here, and the
 *         magnitude of the latter is at least a quarter of x*x/2,
 *         thus, reducing the rounding error in the subtraction.
