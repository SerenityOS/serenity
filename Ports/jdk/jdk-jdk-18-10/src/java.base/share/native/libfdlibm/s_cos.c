/* cos(x)
 * Return cosine function of x.
 *
 * kernel function:
 *      __kernel_sin            ... sine function on [-pi/4,pi/4]
 *      __kernel_cos            ... cosine function on [-pi/4,pi/4]
 *      __ieee754_rem_pio2      ... argument reduction routine
 *
 * Method.
 *      Let S,C and T denote the sin, cos and tan respectively on
 *      [-PI/4, +PI/4]. Reduce the argument x to y1+y2 = x-k*pi/2
 *      in [-pi/4 , +pi/4], and let n = k mod 4.
 *      We have
 *
 *          n        sin(x)      cos(x)        tan(x)

 *          3         -C           S            -1/T
 *     ----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Special cases:
 *      Let trig be any of sin, cos, or tan.
 *      trig(+-INF)  is NaN, with signals;
 *      trig(NaN)    is that NaN;
 *
 * Accuracy:
 *      TRIG(x) returns trig(x) nearly rounded
