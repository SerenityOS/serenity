/**
 * Only the identity of the class of an Externalizable instance is
 * written in the serialization stream and it is the responsibility
 * of the class to save and restore the contents of its instances.
 *
 * The writeExternal and readExternal methods of the Externalizable
 * interface are implemented by a class to give the class complete
 * control over the format and contents of the stream for an object
 * and its supertypes. These methods must explicitly
 * coordinate with the supertype to save its state. These methods supersede
 * customized implementations of writeObject and readObject methods.<br>
 *
 * Object Serialization uses the Serializable and Externalizable
 * interfaces.  Object persistence mechanisms can use them as well.  Each
 * object to be stored is tested for the Externalizable interface. If
 * the object supports Externalizable, the writeExternal method is called. If the
 * object does not support Externalizable and does implement
 * Serializable, the object is saved using
 * ObjectOutputStream. <br> When an Externalizable object is
 * reconstructed, an instance is created using the public no-arg
 * constructor, then the readExternal method called.  Serializable
 * objects are restored by reading them from an ObjectInputStream.<br>
 *
 * An Externalizable instance can designate a substitution object via
 * the writeReplace and readResolve methods documented in the Serializable
 * interface.<br>
