/**
 * The {@code Throwable} class is the superclass of all errors and
 * exceptions in the Java language. Only objects that are instances of this
 * class (or one of its subclasses) are thrown by the Java Virtual Machine or
 * can be thrown by the Java {@code throw} statement. Similarly, only
 * this class or one of its subclasses can be the argument type in a
 * {@code catch} clause.
 *
 * For the purposes of compile-time checking of exceptions, {@code
 * Throwable} and any subclass of {@code Throwable} that is not also a
 * subclass of either {@link RuntimeException} or {@link Error} are
 * regarded as checked exceptions.
 *
 * <p>Instances of two subclasses, {@link java.lang.Error} and
 * {@link java.lang.Exception}, are conventionally used to indicate
 * that exceptional situations have occurred. Typically, these instances
 * are freshly created in the context of the exceptional situation so
 * as to include relevant information (such as stack trace data).
 *
 * <p>A throwable contains a snapshot of the execution stack of its
 * thread at the time it was created. It can also contain a message
 * string that gives more information about the error. Over time, a
 * throwable can {@linkplain Throwable#addSuppressed suppress} other
 * throwables from being propagated.  Finally, the throwable can also
 * contain a <i>cause</i>: another throwable that caused this
 * throwable to be constructed.  The recording of this causal information
 * is referred to as the <i>chained exception</i> facility, as the
 * cause can, itself, have a cause, and so on, leading to a "chain" of
 * exceptions, each caused by another.
 *
 * <p>One reason that a throwable may have a cause is that the class that
 * throws it is built atop a lower layered abstraction, and an operation on
 * the upper layer fails due to a failure in the lower layer.  It would be bad
 * design to let the throwable thrown by the lower layer propagate outward, as
 * it is generally unrelated to the abstraction provided by the upper layer.
 * Further, doing so would tie the API of the upper layer to the details of
 * its implementation, assuming the lower layer's exception was a checked
 * exception.  Throwing a "wrapped exception" (i.e., an exception containing a
 * cause) allows the upper layer to communicate the details of the failure to
 * its caller without incurring either of these shortcomings.  It preserves
 * the flexibility to change the implementation of the upper layer without
 * changing its API (in particular, the set of exceptions thrown by its
 * methods).
 *
 * <p>A second reason that a throwable may have a cause is that the method
 * that throws it must conform to a general-purpose interface that does not
 * permit the method to throw the cause directly.  For example, suppose
 * a persistent collection conforms to the {@link java.util.Collection
 * Collection} interface, and that its persistence is implemented atop
 * {@code java.io}.  Suppose the internals of the {@code add} method
 * can throw an {@link java.io.IOException IOException}.  The implementation
 * can communicate the details of the {@code IOException} to its caller
 * while conforming to the {@code Collection} interface by wrapping the
 * {@code IOException} in an appropriate unchecked exception.  (The
 * specification for the persistent collection should indicate that it is
 * capable of throwing such exceptions.)
 *
 * <p>A cause can be associated with a throwable in two ways: via a
 * constructor that takes the cause as an argument, or via the
 * {@link #initCause(Throwable)} method.  New throwable classes that
 * wish to allow causes to be associated with them should provide constructors
 * that take a cause and delegate (perhaps indirectly) to one of the
 * {@code Throwable} constructors that takes a cause.
 *
 * Because the {@code initCause} method is public, it allows a cause to be
 * associated with any throwable, even a "legacy throwable" whose
 * implementation predates the addition of the exception chaining mechanism to
 * {@code Throwable}.
 *
 * <p>By convention, class {@code Throwable} and its subclasses have two
 * constructors, one that takes no arguments and one that takes a
 * {@code String} argument that can be used to produce a detail message.
 * Further, those subclasses that might likely have a cause associated with
 * them should have two more constructors, one that takes a
 * {@code Throwable} (the cause), and one that takes a
 * {@code String} (the detail message) and a {@code Throwable} (the
 * cause).

     * As of release 7, the platform supports the notion of
     * <i>suppressed exceptions</i> (in conjunction with the {@code
     * try}-with-resources statement). Any exceptions that were
     * suppressed in order to deliver an exception are printed out
     * beneath the stack trace.  The format of this information
     * depends on the implementation, but the following example may be
     * regarded as typical:
     *
     * <pre>
     * Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Exception: Something happened
     *  at Foo.bar(Foo.java:10)
     *  at Foo.main(Foo.java:5)
     *  Suppressed: Resource$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 0
     *          at Resource.close(Resource.java:26)
     *          at Foo.bar(Foo.java:9)
     *          ... 1 more
     * </pre>
     * Note that the "... n more" notation is used on suppressed exceptions
     * just as it is used on causes. Unlike causes, suppressed exceptions are
     * indented beyond their "containing exceptions."
     *
     * <p>An exception can have both a cause and one or more suppressed
     * exceptions:
     * <pre>
     * Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Exception: Main block
     *  at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:7)
     *  Suppressed: Resource$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 2
     *          at Resource.close(Resource.java:26)
     *          at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:5)
     *  Suppressed: Resource$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 1
     *          at Resource.close(Resource.java:26)
     *          at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:5)
     * Caused by: java.lang.Exception: I did it
     *  at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:8)
     * </pre>
     * Likewise, a suppressed exception can have a cause:
     * <pre>
     * Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Exception: Main block
     *  at Foo4.main(Foo4.java:6)
     *  Suppressed: Resource2$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 1
     *          at Resource2.close(Resource2.java:20)
     *          at Foo4.main(Foo4.java:5)
     *  Caused by: java.lang.Exception: Rats, you caught me
     *          at Resource2$CloseFailException.&lt;init&gt;(Resource2.java:45)
     *          ... 2 more
