     * objects in terms of a single {@code TemporalUnit}.
     * The start and end points are {@code this} and the specified time.
     * The result will be negative if the end is before the start.

     * {@code OffsetTime} using {@link #from(TemporalAccessor)}.
     * If the offset differs between the two times, then the specified
     * end time is normalized to have the same offset as this time.
     * <p>
     * The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
     * complete units between the two times.
     * For example, the amount in hours between 11:30Z and 13:29Z will only
     * be one hour as it is one minute short of two hours.

     * <p>
     * The calculation is implemented in this method for {@link ChronoUnit}.
     * The units {@code NANOS}, {@code MICROS}, {@code MILLIS}, {@code SECONDS},
     * {@code MINUTES}, {@code HOURS} and {@code HALF_DAYS} are supported.
     * Other {@code ChronoUnit} values will throw an exception.
     * <p>
     * If the unit is not a {@code ChronoUnit}, then the result of this method
     * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)}
     * passing {@code this} as the first argument and the converted input temporal
     * as the second argument.
