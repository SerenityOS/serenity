/**
 * A {@code DomainCombiner} provides a means to dynamically
 * update the ProtectionDomains associated with the current
 * {@code AccessControlContext}.
 *
 * <p> A {@code DomainCombiner} is passed as a parameter to the
 * appropriate constructor for {@code AccessControlContext}.
 * The newly constructed context is then passed to the
 * {@code AccessController.doPrivileged(..., context)} method
 * to bind the provided context (and associated {@code DomainCombiner})
 * with the current execution Thread.  Subsequent calls to
 * {@code AccessController.getContext} or
 * {@code AccessController.checkPermission}
 * cause the {@code DomainCombiner.combine} to get invoked.
 *
 * <p> The combine method takes two arguments.  The first argument represents
 * an array of ProtectionDomains from the current execution Thread,
 * since the most recent call to {@code AccessController.doPrivileged}.
 * If no call to doPrivileged was made, then the first argument will contain
 * all the ProtectionDomains from the current execution Thread.
 * The second argument represents an array of inherited ProtectionDomains,
 * which may be {@code null}.  ProtectionDomains may be inherited
 * from a parent Thread, or from a privileged context.  If no call to
 * doPrivileged was made, then the second argument will contain the
 * ProtectionDomains inherited from the parent Thread.  If one or more calls
 * to doPrivileged were made, and the most recent call was to
 * doPrivileged(action, context), then the second argument will contain the
 * ProtectionDomains from the privileged context.  If the most recent call
 * was to doPrivileged(action), then there is no privileged context,
 * and the second argument will be {@code null}.
 *
 * <p> The {@code combine} method investigates the two input arrays
 * of ProtectionDomains and returns a single array containing the updated
 * ProtectionDomains.  In the simplest case, the {@code combine}
 * method merges the two stacks into one.  In more complex cases,
 * the {@code combine} method returns a modified
 * stack of ProtectionDomains.  The modification may have added new
 * ProtectionDomains, removed certain ProtectionDomains, or simply
 * updated existing ProtectionDomains.  Re-ordering and other optimizations
 * to the ProtectionDomains are also permitted.  Typically the
 * {@code combine} method bases its updates on the information
 * encapsulated in the {@code DomainCombiner}.
 *
 * <p> After the {@code AccessController.getContext} method
 * receives the combined stack of ProtectionDomains back from
 * the {@code DomainCombiner}, it returns a new
 * AccessControlContext that has both the combined ProtectionDomains
 * as well as the {@code DomainCombiner}.
 *
 * @see AccessController
 * @see AccessControlContext
 * @since 1.3
 * @deprecated This class is only useful in conjunction with
 *       {@linkplain SecurityManager the Security Manager}, which is deprecated
 *       and subject to removal in a future release. Consequently, this class
 *       is also deprecated and subject to removal. There is no replacement for
 *       the Security Manager or this class.
