/**
 * A nexus for I/O operations.
 *
 * <p> A channel represents an open connection to an entity such as a hardware
 * device, a file, a network socket, or a program component that is capable of
 * performing one or more distinct I/O operations, for example reading or
 * writing.
 *
 * <p> A channel is either open or closed.  A channel is open upon creation,
 * and once closed it remains closed.  Once a channel is closed, any attempt to
 * invoke an I/O operation upon it will cause a {@link ClosedChannelException}
 * to be thrown.  Whether or not a channel is open may be tested by invoking
 * its {@link #isOpen isOpen} method.
 *
 * <p> Channels are, in general, intended to be safe for multithreaded access
 * as described in the specifications of the interfaces and classes that extend
 * and implement this interface.
