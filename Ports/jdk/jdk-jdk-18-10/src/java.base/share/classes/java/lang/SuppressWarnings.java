/**
 * Indicates that the named compiler warnings should be suppressed in the
 * annotated element (and in all program elements contained in the annotated
 * element).  Note that the set of warnings suppressed in a given element is
 * a superset of the warnings suppressed in all containing elements.  For
 * example, if you annotate a class to suppress one warning and annotate a
 * method to suppress another, both warnings will be suppressed in the method.
 * However, note that if a warning is suppressed in a {@code
 * module-info} file, the suppression applies to elements within the
 * file and <em>not</em> to types contained within the module.
 *
 * <p>As a matter of style, programmers should always use this annotation
 * on the most deeply nested element where it is effective.  If you want to
 * suppress a warning in a particular method, you should annotate that
 * method rather than its class.
