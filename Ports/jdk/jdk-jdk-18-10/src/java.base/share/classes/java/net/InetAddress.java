/**
 * This class represents an Internet Protocol (IP) address.
 *
 * <p> An IP address is either a 32-bit or 128-bit unsigned number
 * used by IP, a lower-level protocol on which protocols like UDP and
 * TCP are built. The IP address architecture is defined by <a
 * href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc790.txt"><i>RFC&nbsp;790:
 * Assigned Numbers</i></a>, <a
 * href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1918.txt"> <i>RFC&nbsp;1918:
 * Address Allocation for Private Internets</i></a>, <a
 * href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2365.txt"><i>RFC&nbsp;2365:
 * Administratively Scoped IP Multicast</i></a>, and <a
 * href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2373.txt"><i>RFC&nbsp;2373: IP
 * Version 6 Addressing Architecture</i></a>. An instance of an
 * InetAddress consists of an IP address and possibly its
 * corresponding host name (depending on whether it is constructed
 * with a host name or whether it has already done reverse host name
 * resolution).
 *
 * <h2> Address types </h2>
 *
 * <table class="striped" style="margin-left:2em">
 *   <caption style="display:none">Description of unicast and multicast address types</caption>
 *   <thead>
 *   <tr><th scope="col">Address Type</th><th scope="col">Description</th></tr>
 *   </thead>
 *   <tbody>
 *   <tr><th scope="row" style="vertical-align:top">unicast</th>
 *       <td>An identifier for a single interface. A packet sent to
 *         a unicast address is delivered to the interface identified by
 *         that address.
 *
 *         <p> The Unspecified Address -- Also called anylocal or wildcard
 *         address. It must never be assigned to any node. It indicates the
 *         absence of an address. One example of its use is as the target of
 *         bind, which allows a server to accept a client connection on any
 *         interface, in case the server host has multiple interfaces.
 *
 *         <p> The <i>unspecified</i> address must not be used as
 *         the destination address of an IP packet.
 *
 *         <p> The <i>Loopback</i> Addresses -- This is the address
 *         assigned to the loopback interface. Anything sent to this
 *         IP address loops around and becomes IP input on the local
 *         host. This address is often used when testing a
 *         client.</td></tr>
 *   <tr><th scope="row" style="vertical-align:top">multicast</th>
 *       <td>An identifier for a set of interfaces (typically belonging
 *         to different nodes). A packet sent to a multicast address is
 *         delivered to all interfaces identified by that address.</td></tr>
 * </tbody>
 * </table>
 *
 * <h3> IP address scope </h3>
 *
 * <p> <i>Link-local</i> addresses are designed to be used for addressing
 * on a single link for purposes such as auto-address configuration,
 * neighbor discovery, or when no routers are present.
 *
 * <p> <i>Site-local</i> addresses are designed to be used for addressing
 * inside of a site without the need for a global prefix.
 *
 * <p> <i>Global</i> addresses are unique across the internet.
 *
 * <h3> Textual representation of IP addresses </h3>
 *
 * The textual representation of an IP address is address family specific.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * For IPv4 address format, please refer to <A
 * HREF="Inet4Address.html#format">Inet4Address#format</A>; For IPv6
 * address format, please refer to <A
 * HREF="Inet6Address.html#format">Inet6Address#format</A>.
 *
 * <P>There is a <a href="doc-files/net-properties.html#Ipv4IPv6">couple of
 * System Properties</a> affecting how IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are used.</P>
 *
 * <h3> Host Name Resolution </h3>
 *
 * Host name-to-IP address <i>resolution</i> is accomplished through
 * the use of a combination of local machine configuration information
 * and network naming services such as the Domain Name System (DNS)
 * and Network Information Service(NIS). The particular naming
 * services(s) being used is by default the local machine configured
 * one. For any host name, its corresponding IP address is returned.
 *
 * <p> <i>Reverse name resolution</i> means that for any IP address,
 * the host associated with the IP address is returned.
 *
 * <p> The InetAddress class provides methods to resolve host names to
 * their IP addresses and vice versa.
 *
 * <h3> InetAddress Caching </h3>
 *
 * The InetAddress class has a cache to store successful as well as
 * unsuccessful host name resolutions.
 *
 * <p> By default, when a security manager is installed, in order to
 * protect against DNS spoofing attacks,
 * the result of positive host name resolutions are
 * cached forever. When a security manager is not installed, the default
 * behavior is to cache entries for a finite (implementation dependent)
 * period of time. The result of unsuccessful host
 * name resolution is cached for a very short period of time (10
 * seconds) to improve performance.
 *
 * <p> If the default behavior is not desired, then a Java security property
 * can be set to a different Time-to-live (TTL) value for positive
 * caching. Likewise, a system admin can configure a different
 * negative caching TTL value when needed.
 *
 * <p> Two Java security properties control the TTL values used for
 *  positive and negative host name resolution caching:
 *
 * <dl style="margin-left:2em">
 * <dt><b>networkaddress.cache.ttl</b></dt>
 * <dd>Indicates the caching policy for successful name lookups from
 * the name service. The value is specified as an integer to indicate
 * the number of seconds to cache the successful lookup. The default
 * setting is to cache for an implementation specific period of time.
 * <p>
 * A value of -1 indicates "cache forever".
 * </dd>
 * <dt><b>networkaddress.cache.negative.ttl</b> (default: 10)</dt>
 * <dd>Indicates the caching policy for un-successful name lookups
 * from the name service. The value is specified as an integer to
 * indicate the number of seconds to cache the failure for
 * un-successful lookups.
 * <p>
 * A value of 0 indicates "never cache".
 * A value of -1 indicates "cache forever".
 * </dd>
 * </dl>
