/**
 * Soft reference objects, which are cleared at the discretion of the garbage
 * collector in response to memory demand.  Soft references are most often used
 * to implement memory-sensitive caches.
 *
 * <p> Suppose that the garbage collector determines at a certain point in time
 * that an object is <a href="package-summary.html#reachability">softly
 * reachable</a>.  At that time it may choose to clear atomically all soft
 * references to that object and all soft references to any other
 * softly-reachable objects from which that object is reachable through a chain
 * of strong references.  At the same time or at some later time it will
 * enqueue those newly-cleared soft references that are registered with
 * reference queues.
 *
 * <p> All soft references to softly-reachable objects are guaranteed to have
 * been cleared before the virtual machine throws an
 * {@code OutOfMemoryError}.  Otherwise no constraints are placed upon the
 * time at which a soft reference will be cleared or the order in which a set
 * of such references to different objects will be cleared.  Virtual machine
 * implementations are, however, encouraged to bias against clearing
 * recently-created or recently-used soft references.
 *
 * <p> Direct instances of this class may be used to implement simple caches;
 * this class or derived subclasses may also be used in larger data structures
 * to implement more sophisticated caches.  As long as the referent of a soft
 * reference is strongly reachable, that is, is actually in use, the soft
 * reference will not be cleared.  Thus a sophisticated cache can, for example,
 * prevent its most recently used entries from being discarded by keeping
 * strong referents to those entries, leaving the remaining entries to be
 * discarded at the discretion of the garbage collector.
