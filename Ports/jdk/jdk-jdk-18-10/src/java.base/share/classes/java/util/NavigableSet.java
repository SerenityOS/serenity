/**
 * A {@link SortedSet} extended with navigation methods reporting
 * closest matches for given search targets. Methods {@link #lower},
 * {@link #floor}, {@link #ceiling}, and {@link #higher} return elements
 * respectively less than, less than or equal, greater than or equal,
 * and greater than a given element, returning {@code null} if there
 * is no such element.
 *
 * <p>A {@code NavigableSet} may be accessed and traversed in either
 * ascending or descending order.  The {@link #descendingSet} method
 * returns a view of the set with the senses of all relational and
 * directional methods inverted. The performance of ascending
 * operations and views is likely to be faster than that of descending
 * ones.  This interface additionally defines methods {@link
 * #pollFirst} and {@link #pollLast} that return and remove the lowest
 * and highest element, if one exists, else returning {@code null}.
 * Methods
 * {@link #subSet(Object, boolean, Object, boolean) subSet(E, boolean, E, boolean)},
 * {@link #headSet(Object, boolean) headSet(E, boolean)}, and
 * {@link #tailSet(Object, boolean) tailSet(E, boolean)}
 * differ from the like-named {@code SortedSet} methods in accepting
 * additional arguments describing whether lower and upper bounds are
 * inclusive versus exclusive.  Subsets of any {@code NavigableSet}
 * must implement the {@code NavigableSet} interface.
 *
 * <p>The return values of navigation methods may be ambiguous in
 * implementations that permit {@code null} elements. However, even
 * in this case the result can be disambiguated by checking
 * {@code contains(null)}. To avoid such issues, implementations of
 * this interface are encouraged to <em>not</em> permit insertion of
 * {@code null} elements. (Note that sorted sets of {@link
 * Comparable} elements intrinsically do not permit {@code null}.)
 *
 * <p>Methods
 * {@link #subSet(Object, Object) subSet(E, E)},
 * {@link #headSet(Object) headSet(E)}, and
 * {@link #tailSet(Object) tailSet(E)}
 * are specified to return {@code SortedSet} to allow existing
 * implementations of {@code SortedSet} to be compatibly retrofitted to
 * implement {@code NavigableSet}, but extensions and implementations
 * of this interface are encouraged to override these methods to return
 * {@code NavigableSet}.
 *
 * <p>This interface is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/java.base/java/util/package-summary.html#CollectionsFramework">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.
