/**
 * A {@link BlockingQueue} in which producers may wait for consumers
 * to receive elements.  A {@code TransferQueue} may be useful for
 * example in message passing applications in which producers
 * sometimes (using method {@link #transfer}) await receipt of
 * elements by consumers invoking {@code take} or {@code poll}, while
 * at other times enqueue elements (via method {@code put}) without
 * waiting for receipt.
 * {@linkplain #tryTransfer(Object) Non-blocking} and
 * {@linkplain #tryTransfer(Object,long,TimeUnit) time-out} versions of
 * {@code tryTransfer} are also available.
 * A {@code TransferQueue} may also be queried, via {@link
 * #hasWaitingConsumer}, whether there are any threads waiting for
 * items, which is a converse analogy to a {@code peek} operation.
 *
 * <p>Like other blocking queues, a {@code TransferQueue} may be
 * capacity bounded.  If so, an attempted transfer operation may
 * initially block waiting for available space, and/or subsequently
 * block waiting for reception by a consumer.  Note that in a queue
 * with zero capacity, such as {@link SynchronousQueue}, {@code put}
 * and {@code transfer} are effectively synonymous.
