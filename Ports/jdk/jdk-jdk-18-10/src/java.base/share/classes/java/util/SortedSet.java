/**
 * A {@link Set} that further provides a <i>total ordering</i> on its elements.
 * The elements are ordered using their {@linkplain Comparable natural
 * ordering}, or by a {@link Comparator} typically provided at sorted
 * set creation time.  The set's iterator will traverse the set in
 * ascending element order. Several additional operations are provided
 * to take advantage of the ordering.  (This interface is the set
 * analogue of {@link SortedMap}.)
 *
 * <p>All elements inserted into a sorted set must implement the {@code Comparable}
 * interface (or be accepted by the specified comparator).  Furthermore, all
 * such elements must be <i>mutually comparable</i>: {@code e1.compareTo(e2)}
 * (or {@code comparator.compare(e1, e2)}) must not throw a
 * {@code ClassCastException} for any elements {@code e1} and {@code e2} in
 * the sorted set.  Attempts to violate this restriction will cause the
 * offending method or constructor invocation to throw a
 * {@code ClassCastException}.
 *
 * <p>Note that the ordering maintained by a sorted set (whether or not an
 * explicit comparator is provided) must be <i>consistent with equals</i> if
 * the sorted set is to correctly implement the {@code Set} interface.  (See
 * the {@code Comparable} interface or {@code Comparator} interface for a
 * precise definition of <i>consistent with equals</i>.)  This is so because
 * the {@code Set} interface is defined in terms of the {@code equals}
 * operation, but a sorted set performs all element comparisons using its
 * {@code compareTo} (or {@code compare}) method, so two elements that are
 * deemed equal by this method are, from the standpoint of the sorted set,
 * equal.  The behavior of a sorted set <i>is</i> well-defined even if its
 * ordering is inconsistent with equals; it just fails to obey the general
 * contract of the {@code Set} interface.
 *
 * <p>All general-purpose sorted set implementation classes should
 * provide four "standard" constructors: 1) A void (no arguments)
 * constructor, which creates an empty sorted set sorted according to
 * the natural ordering of its elements.  2) A constructor with a
 * single argument of type {@code Comparator}, which creates an empty
 * sorted set sorted according to the specified comparator.  3) A
 * constructor with a single argument of type {@code Collection},
 * which creates a new sorted set with the same elements as its
 * argument, sorted according to the natural ordering of the elements.
 * 4) A constructor with a single argument of type {@code SortedSet},
 * which creates a new sorted set with the same elements and the same
 * ordering as the input sorted set.  There is no way to enforce this
 * recommendation, as interfaces cannot contain constructors.
 *
 * <p>Note: several methods return subsets with restricted ranges.
 * Such ranges are <i>half-open</i>, that is, they include their low
 * endpoint but not their high endpoint (where applicable).
 * If you need a <i>closed range</i> (which includes both endpoints), and
 * the element type allows for calculation of the successor of a given
 * value, merely request the subrange from {@code lowEndpoint} to
 * {@code successor(highEndpoint)}.  For example, suppose that {@code s}
 * is a sorted set of strings.  The following idiom obtains a view
 * containing all of the strings in {@code s} from {@code low} to
 * {@code high}, inclusive:<pre>
 *   SortedSet&lt;String&gt; sub = s.subSet(low, high+"\0");</pre>
 *
 * A similar technique can be used to generate an <i>open range</i> (which
 * contains neither endpoint).  The following idiom obtains a view
 * containing all of the Strings in {@code s} from {@code low} to
 * {@code high}, exclusive:<pre>
 *   SortedSet&lt;String&gt; sub = s.subSet(low+"\0", high);</pre>
 *
 * <p>This interface is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/java.base/java/util/package-summary.html#CollectionsFramework">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.
