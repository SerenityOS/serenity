/**
 * Basic thread blocking primitives for creating locks and other
 * synchronization classes.
 *
 * <p>This class associates, with each thread that uses it, a permit
 * (in the sense of the {@link java.util.concurrent.Semaphore
 * Semaphore} class). A call to {@code park} will return immediately
 * if the permit is available, consuming it in the process; otherwise
 * it <em>may</em> block.  A call to {@code unpark} makes the permit
 * available, if it was not already available. (Unlike with Semaphores
 * though, permits do not accumulate. There is at most one.)
 * Reliable usage requires the use of volatile (or atomic) variables
 * to control when to park or unpark.  Orderings of calls to these
 * methods are maintained with respect to volatile variable accesses,
 * but not necessarily non-volatile variable accesses.
 *
 * <p>Methods {@code park} and {@code unpark} provide efficient
 * means of blocking and unblocking threads that do not encounter the
 * problems that cause the deprecated methods {@code Thread.suspend}
 * and {@code Thread.resume} to be unusable for such purposes: Races
 * between one thread invoking {@code park} and another thread trying
 * to {@code unpark} it will preserve liveness, due to the
 * permit. Additionally, {@code park} will return if the caller's
 * thread was interrupted, and timeout versions are supported. The
 * {@code park} method may also return at any other time, for "no
 * reason", so in general must be invoked within a loop that rechecks
 * conditions upon return. In this sense {@code park} serves as an
 * optimization of a "busy wait" that does not waste as much time
 * spinning, but must be paired with an {@code unpark} to be
 * effective.
 *
 * <p>The three forms of {@code park} each also support a
 * {@code blocker} object parameter. This object is recorded while
 * the thread is blocked to permit monitoring and diagnostic tools to
 * identify the reasons that threads are blocked. (Such tools may
 * access blockers using method {@link #getBlocker(Thread)}.)
 * The use of these forms rather than the original forms without this
 * parameter is strongly encouraged. The normal argument to supply as
 * a {@code blocker} within a lock implementation is {@code this}.
 *
 * <p>These methods are designed to be used as tools for creating
 * higher-level synchronization utilities, and are not in themselves
 * useful for most concurrency control applications.  The {@code park}
 * method is designed for use only in constructions of the form:
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * while (!canProceed()) {
 *   // ensure request to unpark is visible to other threads
 *   ...
 *   LockSupport.park(this);
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * where no actions by the thread publishing a request to unpark,
 * prior to the call to {@code park}, entail locking or blocking.
 * Because only one permit is associated with each thread, any
 * intermediary uses of {@code park}, including implicitly via class
 * loading, could lead to an unresponsive thread (a "lost unpark").
 *
 * <p><b>Sample Usage.</b> Here is a sketch of a first-in-first-out
 * non-reentrant lock class:
 * <pre> {@code
 * class FIFOMutex {
 *   private final AtomicBoolean locked = new AtomicBoolean(false);
 *   private final Queue<Thread> waiters
 *     = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue<>();
 *
 *   public void lock() {
 *     boolean wasInterrupted = false;
 *     // publish current thread for unparkers
 *     waiters.add(Thread.currentThread());
 *
 *     // Block while not first in queue or cannot acquire lock
 *     while (waiters.peek() != Thread.currentThread() ||
 *            !locked.compareAndSet(false, true)) {
 *       LockSupport.park(this);
 *       // ignore interrupts while waiting
 *       if (Thread.interrupted())
 *         wasInterrupted = true;
 *     }
 *
 *     waiters.remove();
 *     // ensure correct interrupt status on return
 *     if (wasInterrupted)
 *       Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
 *   }
 *
 *   public void unlock() {
 *     locked.set(false);
 *     LockSupport.unpark(waiters.peek());
 *   }
 *
 *   static {
 *     // Reduce the risk of "lost unpark" due to classloading
 *     Class<?> ensureLoaded = LockSupport.class;
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * @since 1.5
