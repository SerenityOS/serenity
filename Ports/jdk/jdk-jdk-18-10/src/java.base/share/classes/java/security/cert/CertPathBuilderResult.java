/**
 * A specification of the result of a certification path builder algorithm.

 * CertPathBuilder.build} method must implement this interface.
 * <p>
 * At a minimum, a {@code CertPathBuilderResult} contains the
 * {@code CertPath} built by the {@code CertPathBuilder} instance.
 * Implementations of this interface may add methods to return implementation
 * or algorithm specific information, such as debugging information or
 * certification path validation results.
 * <p>
 * <b>Concurrent Access</b>
 * <p>
 * Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this interface are not
 * thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single
 * object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and
 * provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating
 * separate objects need not synchronize.
