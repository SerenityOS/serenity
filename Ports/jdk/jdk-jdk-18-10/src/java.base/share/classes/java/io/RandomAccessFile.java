/**
 * Instances of this class support both reading and writing to a
 * random access file. A random access file behaves like a large
 * array of bytes stored in the file system. There is a kind of cursor,
 * or index into the implied array, called the <em>file pointer</em>;
 * input operations read bytes starting at the file pointer and advance
 * the file pointer past the bytes read. If the random access file is
 * created in read/write mode, then output operations are also available;
 * output operations write bytes starting at the file pointer and advance
 * the file pointer past the bytes written. Output operations that write
 * past the current end of the implied array cause the array to be
 * extended. The file pointer can be read by the
 * {@code getFilePointer} method and set by the {@code seek}
 * method.
 * <p>
 * It is generally true of all the reading routines in this class that
 * if end-of-file is reached before the desired number of bytes has been
 * read, an {@code EOFException} (which is a kind of
 * {@code IOException}) is thrown. If any byte cannot be read for
 * any reason other than end-of-file, an {@code IOException} other
 * than {@code EOFException} is thrown. In particular, an
 * {@code IOException} may be thrown if the stream has been closed.
