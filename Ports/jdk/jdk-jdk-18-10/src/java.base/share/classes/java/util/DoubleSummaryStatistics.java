/**
 * A state object for collecting statistics such as count, min, max, sum, and
 * average.
 *
 * <p>This class is designed to work with (though does not require)
 * {@linkplain java.util.stream streams}. For example, you can compute
 * summary statistics on a stream of doubles with:
 * <pre> {@code
 * DoubleSummaryStatistics stats = doubleStream.collect(DoubleSummaryStatistics::new,
 *                                                      DoubleSummaryStatistics::accept,
 *                                                      DoubleSummaryStatistics::combine);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>{@code DoubleSummaryStatistics} can be used as a
 * {@linkplain java.util.stream.Stream#collect(Collector) reduction}
 * target for a {@linkplain java.util.stream.Stream stream}. For example:
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * DoubleSummaryStatistics stats = people.stream()
 *     .collect(Collectors.summarizingDouble(Person::getWeight));
 *}</pre>
 *
 * This computes, in a single pass, the count of people, as well as the minimum,
 * maximum, sum, and average of their weights.
 *
 * @implNote This implementation is not thread safe. However, it is safe to use
 * {@link java.util.stream.Collectors#summarizingDouble(java.util.function.ToDoubleFunction)
 * Collectors.summarizingDouble()} on a parallel stream, because the parallel
 * implementation of {@link java.util.stream.Stream#collect Stream.collect()}
 * provides the necessary partitioning, isolation, and merging of results for
 * safe and efficient parallel execution.
 *
 * <p>This implementation does not check for overflow of the count.
 * @since 1.8

     * summation or other technique to reduce the error bound in the
     * numerical sum compared to a simple summation of {@code double}
     * values.
     *
     * Because of the unspecified order of operations and the
     * possibility of using differing summation schemes, the output of
     * this method may vary on the same input values.
     *
     * <p>Various conditions can result in a non-finite sum being
     * computed. This can occur even if the all the recorded values
     * being summed are finite. If any recorded value is non-finite,
     * the sum will be non-finite:
     *
     * <ul>

     * <li>If any recorded value is a NaN, then the final sum will be
     * NaN.

     * <li>If the recorded values contain one or more infinities, the
     * sum will be infinite or NaN.
     *
     * <ul>
     *
     * <li>If the recorded values contain infinities of opposite sign,
     * the sum will be NaN.

     * an intermediate sum overflows to an infinity of the opposite
     * sign, the sum may be NaN.

     * </ul>
     *
     * </ul>
     *
     * It is possible for intermediate sums of finite values to
     * overflow into opposite-signed infinities; if that occurs, the
     * final sum will be NaN even if the recorded values are all
     * finite.
     *
     * If all the recorded values are zero, the sign of zero is
     * <em>not</em> guaranteed to be preserved in the final sum.
