/**
 * A {@linkplain BlockingQueue blocking queue} in which each insert
 * operation must wait for a corresponding remove operation by another
 * thread, and vice versa.  A synchronous queue does not have any
 * internal capacity, not even a capacity of one.  You cannot
 * {@code peek} at a synchronous queue because an element is only
 * present when you try to remove it; you cannot insert an element
 * (using any method) unless another thread is trying to remove it;
 * you cannot iterate as there is nothing to iterate.  The
 * <em>head</em> of the queue is the element that the first queued
 * inserting thread is trying to add to the queue; if there is no such
 * queued thread then no element is available for removal and
 * {@code poll()} will return {@code null}.  For purposes of other
 * {@code Collection} methods (for example {@code contains}), a
 * {@code SynchronousQueue} acts as an empty collection.  This queue
 * does not permit {@code null} elements.
 *
 * <p>Synchronous queues are similar to rendezvous channels used in
 * CSP and Ada. They are well suited for handoff designs, in which an
 * object running in one thread must sync up with an object running
 * in another thread in order to hand it some information, event, or
 * task.
 *
 * <p>This class supports an optional fairness policy for ordering
 * waiting producer and consumer threads.  By default, this ordering
 * is not guaranteed. However, a queue constructed with fairness set
 * to {@code true} grants threads access in FIFO order.
 *
 * <p>This class and its iterator implement all of the <em>optional</em>
 * methods of the {@link Collection} and {@link Iterator} interfaces.
 *
 * <p>This class is a member of the

     * This class implements extensions of the dual stack and dual
     * queue algorithms described in "Nonblocking Concurrent Objects
     * with Condition Synchronization", by W. N. Scherer III and
     * M. L. Scott.  18th Annual Conf. on Distributed Computing,
     * Oct. 2004 (see also
     * http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/scott/synchronization/pseudocode/duals.html).
     * The (Lifo) stack is used for non-fair mode, and the (Fifo)
     * queue for fair mode. The performance of the two is generally
     * similar. Fifo usually supports higher throughput under
     * contention but Lifo maintains higher thread locality in common
     * applications.
     *
     * A dual queue (and similarly stack) is one that at any given
     * time either holds "data" -- items provided by put operations,
     * or "requests" -- slots representing take operations, or is
     * empty. A call to "fulfill" (i.e., a call requesting an item
     * from a queue holding data or vice versa) dequeues a
     * complementary node.  The most interesting feature of these
     * queues is that any operation can figure out which mode the
     * queue is in, and act accordingly without needing locks.
     *
     * Both the queue and stack extend abstract class Transferer
     * defining the single method transfer that does a put or a
     * take. These are unified into a single method because in dual
     * data structures, the put and take operations are symmetrical,
     * so nearly all code can be combined. The resulting transfer
     * methods are on the long side, but are easier to follow than
     * they would be if broken up into nearly-duplicated parts.
     *
     * The queue and stack data structures share many conceptual
     * similarities but very few concrete details. For simplicity,
     * they are kept distinct so that they can later evolve
     * separately.
     *
     * The algorithms here differ from the versions in the above paper
     * in extending them for use in synchronous queues, as well as
     * dealing with cancellation. The main differences include:
     *
     *  1. The original algorithms used bit-marked pointers, but
     *     the ones here use mode bits in nodes, leading to a number
     *     of further adaptations.
     *  2. SynchronousQueues must block threads waiting to become
     *     fulfilled.
     *  3. Support for cancellation via timeout and interrupts,
     *     including cleaning out cancelled nodes/threads
     *     from lists to avoid garbage retention and memory depletion.
     *
     * Blocking is mainly accomplished using LockSupport park/unpark,
     * except that nodes that appear to be the next ones to become
     * fulfilled first spin a bit (on multiprocessors only). On very
     * busy synchronous queues, spinning can dramatically improve
     * throughput. And on less busy ones, the amount of spinning is
     * small enough not to be noticeable.
     *
     * Cleaning is done in different ways in queues vs stacks.  For
     * queues, we can almost always remove a node immediately in O(1)
     * time (modulo retries for consistency checks) when it is
     * cancelled. But if it may be pinned as the current tail, it must
     * wait until some subsequent cancellation. For stacks, we need a
     * potentially O(n) traversal to be sure that we can remove the
     * node, but this can run concurrently with other threads
     * accessing the stack.
     *
     * While garbage collection takes care of most node reclamation
     * issues that otherwise complicate nonblocking algorithms, care
     * is taken to "forget" references to data, other nodes, and
     * threads that might be held on to long-term by blocked
     * threads. In cases where setting to null would otherwise
     * conflict with main algorithms, this is done by changing a
     * node's link to now point to the node itself. This doesn't arise
     * much for Stack nodes (because blocked threads do not hang on to
     * old head pointers), but references in Queue nodes must be
     * aggressively forgotten to avoid reachability of everything any
     * node has ever referred to since arrival.
     *
     * The above steps improve throughput when many threads produce
     * and/or consume data. But they don't help much with
     * single-source / single-sink usages in which one side or the
     * other is always transiently blocked, and so throughput is
     * mainly a function of thread scheduling. This is not usually
     * noticeably improved with bounded short spin-waits. Instead both
     * forms of transfer try Thread.yield if apparently the sole
     * waiter. This works well when there are more tasks that cores,
     * which is expected to be the main usage context of this mode. In
     * other cases, waiters may help with some bookkeeping, then
     * park/unpark.
