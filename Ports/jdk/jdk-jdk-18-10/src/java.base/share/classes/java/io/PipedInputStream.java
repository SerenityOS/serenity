/**
 * A piped input stream should be connected
 * to a piped output stream; the piped  input
 * stream then provides whatever data bytes
 * are written to the piped output  stream.
 * Typically, data is read from a {@code PipedInputStream}
 * object by one thread  and data is written
 * to the corresponding {@code PipedOutputStream}
 * by some  other thread. Attempting to use
 * both objects from a single thread is not
 * recommended, as it may deadlock the thread.
 * The piped input stream contains a buffer,
 * decoupling read operations from write operations,
 * within limits.
 * A pipe is said to be <a id="BROKEN"> <i>broken</i> </a> if a
 * thread that was providing data bytes to the connected
 * piped output stream is no longer alive.
