/**
 * This class defines the <i>Service Provider Interface</i> (<b>SPI</b>)
 * for the <code>KeyGenerator</code> class.
 * All the abstract methods in this class must be implemented by each
 * cryptographic service provider who wishes to supply the implementation
 * of a key generator for a particular algorithm.
 *
 * <p>In case the client does not explicitly initialize the KeyGenerator
 * (via a call to an {@code init} method), each provider must
 * supply (and document) a default initialization.
 * See the Keysize Restriction sections of the
 * {@extLink security_guide_jdk_providers JDK Providers}
 * document for information on the KeyGenerator defaults used by
 * JDK providers.
 * However, note that defaults may vary across different providers.
 * Additionally, the default value for a provider may change in a future
 * version. Therefore, it is recommended to explicitly initialize the
 * KeyGenerator instead of relying on provider-specific defaults.
