.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[I]load\-files\f[R]
One or more scripts to run when the tool is started.
Scripts can contain any valid code snippets or JShell commands.
.RS
.PP
The script can be a local file or one of following predefined scripts:
.TP
.B \f[CB]DEFAULT\f[R]
Loads the default entries, which are commonly used as imports.
.RS
.RE

\f[CB]jshell\f[R] methods for use within the tool.
.RS
.RE
.PP
For more than one script, use a space to separate the names.
Scripts are run in the order in which they\[aq]re entered on the command
line.
Command\-line scripts are run after startup scripts.
To run a script after JShell is started, use the \f[CB]/open\f[R] command.
.PP
To accept input from standard input and suppress the interactive I/O,
enter a hyphen (\-) for \f[I]load\-files\f[R].
This option enables the use of the \f[CB]jshell\f[R] tool in pipe chains.
.RE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
JShell provides a way to interactively evaluate declarations,
statements, and expressions of the Java programming language, making it
easier to learn the language, explore unfamiliar code and APIs, and
prototype complex code.
Java statements, variable definitions, method definitions, class
definitions, import statements, and expressions are accepted.
The bits of code entered are called snippets.
.PP
As snippets are entered, they\[aq]re evaluated, and feedback is
provided.
Feedback varies from the results and explanations of actions to nothing,
depending on the snippet entered and the feedback mode chosen.
Errors are described regardless of the feedback mode.
Start with the verbose mode to get the most feedback while learning the
tool.
.PP
Command\-line options are available for configuring the initial
environment when JShell is started.
Within JShell, commands are available for modifying the environment as
needed.
.PP
Existing snippets can be loaded from a file to initialize a JShell
session, or at any time within a session.
Snippets can be modified within the session to try out different
variations and make corrections.
To keep snippets for later use, save them to a file.

However, \f[CB]/s\f[R] isn\[aq]t a valid abbreviation because it can\[aq]t
be determined if the \f[CB]/set\f[R] or \f[CB]/save\f[R] command is meant.
Use \f[CB]/se\f[R] for the \f[CB]/set\f[R] command or \f[CB]/sa\f[R] for the
\f[CB]/save\f[R] command.

Abbreviations are also accepted for subcommands, command arguments, and
command options.
For example, use \f[CB]/m\ \-a\f[R] to display all methods.
.SS History navigation

.PP
To change the method \f[CB]grade\f[R] to allow more students to pass,
enter the method definition again and change the pass score to
\f[CB]80\f[R].
Use the up arrow key to retrieve the previous entries to avoid having to
reenter them and make the change in the \f[CB]if\f[R] statement.
The following example shows the new definition and reruns the method to

.PP
For snippets that are more than a few lines long, or to make more than a
few changes, use the \f[CB]/edit\f[R] command to open the snippet in an
editor.
After the changes are complete, close the edit window to return control
to the JShell session.
The following example shows the command and the feedback provided when
the edit window is closed.
The \f[CB]/list\f[R] command is used to show that the pass score was
changed to \f[CB]85\f[R].

.SH EXAMPLE OF CREATING A CUSTOM FEEDBACK MODE
.PP
The feedback mode determines the prompt that\[aq]s displayed, the
feedback messages that are provided as snippets are entered, and the
maximum length of a displayed value.
Predefined feedback modes are provided.
Commands for creating custom feedback modes are also provided.
.PP
Use the \f[CB]/set\ mode\f[R] command to create a new feedback mode.
In the following example, the new mode \f[CB]mymode\f[R], is based on the
predefined feedback mode, \f[CB]normal\f[R], and verifying command
feedback is displayed:
.IP
.nf
\f[CB]
jshell>\ /set\ mode\ mymode\ normal\ \-command
|\ \ Created\ new\ feedback\ mode:\ mymode
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Because the new mode is based on the \f[CB]normal\f[R] mode, the prompts
are the same.
The following example shows how to see what prompts are used and then
changes the prompts to custom strings.
The first string represents the standard JShell prompt.
The second string represents the prompt for additional lines in
multiline snippets.
.IP
.nf
\f[CB]
jshell>\ /set\ prompt\ mymode
|\ \ /set\ prompt\ mymode\ "\\njshell>\ "\ "\ \ \ ...>\ "

jshell>\ /set\ prompt\ mymode\ "\\nprompt$\ "\ "\ \ \ continue$\ "
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The maximum length of a displayed value is controlled by the truncation
setting.
Different types of values can have different lengths.
The following example sets an overall truncation value of 72, and a
truncation value of 500 for variable value expressions:
.IP
.nf
\f[CB]
jshell>\ /set\ truncation\ mymode\ 72

jshell>\ /set\ truncation\ mymode\ 500\ varvalue
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The feedback displayed after snippets are entered is controlled by the
format setting and is based on the type of snippet entered and the
action taken for that snippet.
In the predefined mode \f[CB]normal\f[R], the string \f[CB]created\f[R] is
displayed when a method is created.
The following example shows how to change that string to
\f[CB]defined\f[R]:
.IP
.nf
\f[CB]
jshell>\ /set\ format\ mymode\ action\ "defined"\ added\-primary
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Use the \f[CB]/set\ feedback\f[R] command to start using the feedback mode
that was just created.
The following example shows the custom mode in use:
.IP
.nf
\f[CB]
jshell>\ /set\ feedback\ mymode
|\ \ Feedback\ mode:\ mymode

prompt$\ int\ square\ (int\ num1){
\ \ \ continue$\ return\ num1*num1;
\ \ \ continue$\ }
|\ \ defined\ method\ square(int)

prompt$
\f[R]
.fi
