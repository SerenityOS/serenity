 * Returns an NSString in decomposed UTF16 format that is compatible with HFS's
 * expectation of the UTF16 format for file system paths.
 *
 * Example string: "/Users/Am√©lie/"
 *
 * Java's UTF16 string is "/ U s e r s / A m \351 l i e /"
 * macOS UTF16 string suitable for HFS is "/ U s e r s / A m e \314 \201 l i e /"
 *
 * There is no direct API that takes in NSString UTF16 encoded by Java
 * and produces NSString UTF16 for HFS, so we first need to decompose it
 * into chars (suitable for low level C file APIs), and only then
 * create NSString representation of this decomposition back into UTF16 string.
 *
 * https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsstring/1414559-filesystemrepresentation?language=objc
 * describes how to get a file system representation as a char* from an NSString
 * and then using FileManager (!) convert it to an NSString.
 * But we want an NSString.
 * So the steps are
 * 1) Convert to NSString
 * 2) call [NSString fileSystemRepresentation] which gives us a char*
 * 3) Convert the returned char* to an NSString using FileManager (is there a better way?)
