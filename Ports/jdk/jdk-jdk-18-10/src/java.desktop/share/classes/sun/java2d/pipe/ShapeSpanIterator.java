/**
 * This class can iterate individual span elements generated by scan
 * converting a Shape.
 * This particular implementation flattens the incoming path and then
 * performs simple polygon tracing to calculate the spans.
 *
 * Note that this class holds pointers to native data which must be
 * disposed.  It is not marked as finalizable since it is intended
 * to be very lightweight and finalization is a comparitively expensive
 * procedure.  The caller must specifically use try{} finally{} to
 * manually ensure that the object is disposed after use, otherwise
 * native data structures might be leaked.
 *
 * Here is a code sample for using this class:
 *
 * public void fillShape(Shape s, Rectangle clipRect) {
 *     ShapeSpanIterator ssi = new ShapeSpanIterator(false);
 *     try {
 *         ssi.setOutputArea(clipRect);
 *         ssi.appendPath(s.getPathIterator(null));
 *         int spanbox[] = new int[4];
 *         while (ssi.nextSpan(spanbox)) {
 *             int x = spanbox[0];
 *             int y = spanbox[1];
 *             int w = spanbox[2] - x;
 *             int h = spanbox[3] - y;
 *             fillRect(x, y, w, h);
 *         }
 *     } finally {
 *         ssi.dispose();
 *     }
 * }
