/**
 * Class {@code PagesPerMinuteColor} is an integer valued printing attribute
 * that indicates the nominal number of pages per minute to the nearest whole
 * number which may be generated by this printer when printing color (e.g.,
 * simplex, color). For purposes of this attribute, "color" means the same as
 * for the {@link ColorSupported ColorSupported} attribute, namely, the device
 * is capable of any type of color printing at all, including highlight color as
 * well as full process color. This attribute is informative, not a service
 * guarantee. Generally, it is the value used in the marketing literature to
 * describe the color capabilities of this device. A value of 0 indicates a
 * device that takes more than two minutes to process a page. If a color device
 * has several color modes, it may use the pages-per- minute value for this
 * attribute that corresponds to the mode that produces the highest number.
 * <p>
 * A black and white only printer must not include the
 * {@code PagesPerMinuteColor} attribute in its attribute set or service
 * registration. If this attribute is present, then the
 * {@link ColorSupported ColorSupported} printer description attribute must also
 * be present and have a value of {@code SUPPORTED}.
 * <p>
 * <b>IPP Compatibility:</b> The integer value gives the IPP integer value. The
 * category name returned by {@code getName()} gives the IPP attribute name.
