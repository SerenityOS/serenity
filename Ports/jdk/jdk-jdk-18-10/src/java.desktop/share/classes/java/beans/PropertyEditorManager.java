/**
 * The PropertyEditorManager can be used to locate a property editor for
 * any given type name.  This property editor must support the
 * java.beans.PropertyEditor interface for editing a given object.
 * <P>
 * The PropertyEditorManager uses three techniques for locating an editor
 * for a given type.  First, it provides a registerEditor method to allow
 * an editor to be specifically registered for a given type.  Second it
 * tries to locate a suitable class by adding "Editor" to the full
 * qualified classname of the given type (e.g. "foo.bah.FozEditor").
 * Finally it takes the simple classname (without the package name) adds
 * "Editor" to it and looks in a search-path of packages for a matching
 * class.
 * <P>
 * So for an input class foo.bah.Fred, the PropertyEditorManager would
 * first look in its tables to see if an editor had been registered for
 * foo.bah.Fred and if so use that.  Then it will look for a
 * foo.bah.FredEditor class.  Then it will look for (say)
 * standardEditorsPackage.FredEditor class.
 * <p>
 * Default PropertyEditors will be provided for the Java primitive types
 * "boolean", "byte", "short", "int", "long", "float", and "double"; and
 * for the classes java.lang.String. java.awt.Color, and java.awt.Font.
 *
