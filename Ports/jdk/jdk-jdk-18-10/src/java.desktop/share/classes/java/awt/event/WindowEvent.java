 * A low-level event that indicates that a window has changed its status. This
 * low-level event is generated by a Window object when it is opened, closed,
 * activated, deactivated, iconified, or deiconified, or when focus is
 * transferred into or out of the Window.
 * <P>
 * The event is passed to every {@code WindowListener}

 * <p>
 * An unspecified behavior will be caused if the {@code id} parameter
