/**
 * A semantic event which indicates that an object's text changed.
 * This high-level event is generated by an object (such as a TextComponent)
 * when its text changes. The event is passed to
 * every {@code TextListener} object which registered to receive such
 * events using the component's {@code addTextListener} method.
 * <P>
 * The object that implements the {@code TextListener} interface gets
 * this {@code TextEvent} when the event occurs. The listener is
 * spared the details of processing individual mouse movements and key strokes
 * Instead, it can process a "meaningful" (semantic) event like "text changed".
 * <p>
 * An unspecified behavior will be caused if the {@code id} parameter
 * of any particular {@code TextEvent} instance is not
 * in the range from {@code TEXT_FIRST} to {@code TEXT_LAST}.
