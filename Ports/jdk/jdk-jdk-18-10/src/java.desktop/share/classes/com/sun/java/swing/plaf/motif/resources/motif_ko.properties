# This properties file is used to create a PropertyResourceBundle
# It contains Locale specific strings used be the Motif Look and Feel.
# Currently, the following components need this for support:
#
#    FileChooser
#
# When this file is read in, the strings are put into the 
# defaults table.  This is an implementation detail of the current
# workings of Swing.  DO NOT DEPEND ON THIS.  
# This may change in future versions of Swing as we improve localization 
# support.

# Refer to the note in basic.properties for a description as to what
# the mnemonics correspond to and how to calculate them.
