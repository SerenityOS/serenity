 * @short_description: Conversion of text strings into positioned glyphs
 * @include: hb.h
 *
 * Shaping is the central operation of HarfBuzz. Shaping operates on buffers,
 * which are sequences of Unicode characters that use the same font and have
 * the same text direction, script, and language. After shaping the buffer
 * contains the output glyphs and their positions.
