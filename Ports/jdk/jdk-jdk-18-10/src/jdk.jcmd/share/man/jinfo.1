.B \f[I]pid\f[R]
The process ID for which the configuration information is to be printed.
The process must be a Java process.
To get a list of Java processes running on a machine, use either the

separate docker instance, the \f[B]jps\f[R] command.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[CB]jinfo\f[R] command prints Java configuration information for a
specified Java process.
The configuration information includes Java system properties and JVM
command\-line flags.
If the specified process is running on a 64\-bit JVM, then you might
need to specify the \f[CB]\-J\-d64\f[R] option, for example:
.RS
.PP
\f[CB]jinfo\ \-J\-d64\ \-sysprops\f[R] \f[I]pid\f[R]
.RE
.PP
This command is unsupported and might not be available in future
releases of the JDK.
In Windows Systems where \f[CB]dbgeng.dll\f[R] is not present, the
Debugging Tools for Windows must be installed to have these tools work.
The \f[CB]PATH\f[R] environment variable should contain the location of
the \f[CB]jvm.dll\f[R] that\[aq]s used by the target process or the
location from which the core dump file was produced.
