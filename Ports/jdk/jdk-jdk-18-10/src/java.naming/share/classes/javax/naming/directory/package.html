Extends the <code>javax.naming</code> package to provide functionality
for accessing directory services.

<p>
This package defines the directory operations of the Java Naming and
Directory Interface (JNDI). &nbsp;
JNDI provides naming and directory functionality to applications
written in the Java programming language.  It is designed to be
independent of any specific naming or directory service
implementation.  Thus a variety of services--new, emerging, and
already deployed ones--can be accessed in a common way.

<p>
This package allows applications to retrieve and update attributes
associated with objects stored in a directory, and to search for
objects using specified attributes.

<h2>The Directory Context</h2>

The <code>DirContext</code>
interface represents a <em>directory context</em>.
It defines methods for examining and updating attributes associated with a
<em>directory object</em>, or <em>directory entry</em> as it is sometimes
called.
<p>
You use	<code>getAttributes()</code> to retrieve the attributes
associated with a directory object (for which you supply the name).
Attributes are modified using <code>modifyAttributes()</code>.
You can add, replace, or remove attributes and/or attribute values
using this operation.
<p>
<code>DirContext</code> also behaves as a naming context
by extending the <code>Context</code> interface in the <code>javax.naming</code> package.
This means that any directory object can also provide
a naming context. 
For example, the directory object for a person might contain
the attributes of that person, and at the same time provide
a context for naming objects relative to that person
such as his printers and home directory.

<h3>Searches</h3>
<code>DirContext</code> contains methods for
performing content-based searching of the directory.
In the simplest and most common form of usage, the application
specifies a set of attributes--possibly with specific
values--to match, and submits this attribute set, to the
<code>search()</code> method.
There are other overloaded forms of <code>search()</code>
that support more sophisticated <em>search filters</em>.


<h2>Package Specification</h2>

The JNDI API Specification and related documents can be found in the
{@extLink jndi_overview JNDI documentation}.
