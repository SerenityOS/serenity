/**
 *  This doclet-independent package has a set of classes and
 *  interfaces that are the building blocks for doclets. They
 *  define the basic structure of doclets and make doclet
 *  writing much easier because they provide the content generation
 *  code to be shared among different doclets. Builders only provide
 *  the structure and content of API documentation.
 *  They do not directly provide any style markup.
 *
 *  <p><b>This is NOT part of any supported API.
 *  If you write code that depends on this, you do so at your own risk.
 *  This code and its internal interfaces are subject to change or
 *  deletion without notice.</b>
