      The DOM bindings are published under the W3C Software Copyright Notice
      and License. The software license requires "Notice of any changes or
      modifications to the W3C files, including the date changes were made."
      Consequently, modified versions of the DOM bindings must document that
      they do not conform to the W3C standard; in the case of the IDL
      definitions, the pragma prefix can no longer be 'w3c.org'; in the case of
      the Java language binding, the package names can no longer be in the
      'org.w3c' package.
