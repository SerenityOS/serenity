/** Models the "sstGlobalPub" subsection in Visual C++ 5.0 debug
    information, which contains globally compacted symbols from the
    sstPublics. This class provides access to the symbols via
    iterators; it does not instantiate objects to represent symbols
    because of the expected high volume of symbols. The caller is
    expected to traverse this table and convert the platform-dependent
    symbols into a platform-independent format at run time. */
