# Patches for zig on SerenityOS

## `0001-clang-Add-support-for-SerenityOS.patch`

Add support for SerenityOS

Adds support for the `$arch-pc-serenity` target to the Clang front end.
This makes the compiler look for libraries and headers in the right
places, and enables some security mitigations like stack-smashing
protection and position-independent code by default.

## `0002-llvm-Add-support-for-building-LLVM-on-SerenityOS.patch`

Add support for building LLVM on SerenityOS

Adds SerenityOS `#ifdef`s for platform-specific code.

We stub out wait4, as SerenityOS doesn't support querying a child
process's resource usage information.

POSIX shm is not supported by SerenityOS yet, so disable it in Orc.

Serenity gives each thread a default of 1MiB of stack. Increase the
default stack size for llvm applications when running on SerenityOS.


## `0003-tools-Support-building-shared-libLLVM-and-libClang-f.patch`

Support building shared libLLVM and libClang for SerenityOS

This patch tells CMake that the --whole-archive linker option should be
used for specifying the archives whose members will constitute these
shared libraries.

Symbol versioning is disabled, as the SerenityOS loader doesn't support
it, and the ELF sections that store version data would just waste space.

## `0004-libcxx-Add-support-for-SerenityOS.patch`

Add support for SerenityOS

This commit teaches libc++ about what features are available in our
LibC, namely:
* We do not have locale support, so no-op shims should be used in place
  of the C locale API.
* The number of errno constants defined by us is given by the value of
  the `ELAST` macro.
* Multithreading is implemented though the pthread library.
* Use libc++'s builtin character type table instead of the one provided
  by LibC as there's a lot of extra porting work to convince the rest of
  locale.cpp to use our character type table properly.

This commit is an adaptation of the LLVM patch by Daniel Bertalan to fit
the layout of the zig-bootstrap project.


## `0005-Extend-support-for-SerenityOS-target.patch`

Extend support for SerenityOS target


## `0006-build-Adjust-build-process-for-SerenityOS.patch`

build: Adjust build process for SerenityOS


## `0007-zlib-Fix-implicit-write-method-declaration-error.patch`

zlib: Fix implicit write() method declaration error


## `0008-build-Remove-unsupported-zig-linker-flag-z-separate-.patch`

build: Remove unsupported zig linker flag -z separate-code


## `0009-doctest-Filter-ZIG_LIBC-from-the-environment.patch`

doctest: Filter ZIG_LIBC from the environment

This environment variable can leak into the doctest builds and cause
them to look for the host libraries in the target libc locations.

## `0010-build-Set-Zig-version-to-0.15.0-dev.1380-e98aeeb73.patch`

build: Set Zig version to 0.15.0-dev.1380+e98aeeb73


## `0011-build-Reduce-requested-stack-size-to-32-MiB.patch`

build: Reduce requested stack size to 32 MiB
