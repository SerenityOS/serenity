/*
 * Bug:
 * A process can join a process group across sessions if both process groups
 * do not have a leader (anymore). This can be used to join a session
 * illegitimately. (Or, more harmlessly, to change the own PGID to an unused
 * but arbitrary one, for example the PGID 0xDEADBEEF or the one that's going
 * to be your program's session ID in the short-term future.)
 *
 * So what needs to happen:
 * - There is session SA
 * - There is session SB
 * - There is a Process Group PGA in SA
 * - There is a Process Group PGB in SB
 * - PGA does not have a leader
 * - PGB does not have a leader
 * - There is a Process PA2 in PGA
 * - There is a Process PB2 in PGB
 * - PA2 calls setpgid(0, PGB)
 * - Now PA2 and PB2 are in the same processgroup, but not in the same session. WHAAAAT! :^)
 *
 * Here's how to demonstrate the bug:
 * - Time 0: PX forks into PA1
 * - Time 1: PA1 creates a new session (SA) and pgrp (PGA)
 * - Time 2: PA1 forks into PA2
 * - Time 3: PA1 dies (PGA now has no leader)
 *     Note: PA2 never dies. Too much hassle.
 * - Time 4: PX forks into PB1
 * - Time 5: PB1 creates a new session (SB) and pgrp (PGB)
 * - Time 6: PB1 forks into PB2
 * - Time 7: PB1 dies (PGB now has no leader)
 * - Time 8: PB2 calls pgrp(0, PGA)
 *     Note: PB2 writes "1" (exploit successful) or "0" (bug is fixed) to a pipe
 * - Time 9: If PX hasn't received any message yet through the pipe, it declares the test as failed (for lack of knowledge). Otherwise, it outputs accordingly.
