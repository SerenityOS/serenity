# FIXME: We could eliminate this setting by building LibC and support asm files (crti.o, crtn.o)
#        in a separate build stage before the main build to ensure that LibC is available
#        for the try_compile check for the main build.
#        Note that `set(CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE STATIC_LIBRARY)` is not a suitable replacement,
#        since applications might try and use `try_compile()` to detect which library a symbol is in,
#        which doesn't work when using static linking.
#        Instead, just tell CMake directly that the compiler works fine, so that it doesn't have to run
#        a compile check before the build.
